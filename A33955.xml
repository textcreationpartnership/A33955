            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AFter that I was perſwaded to let the
world ſee theſe <hi>Receits,</hi> I thought it
policy to give them as much allowance of
advantage, as they were capable of, and to this
end, I have preſumed to offer them to your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
for your <hi>probatum eſt.</hi> The Sermons
never yet were made more publike, then the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chappel belonging to this Family, where
they have been offered to the ears of thoſe that
have importuned me to venture them upon a
publike cenſure. My deſigne from the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that private Lecture, was to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
diverſe doubting Chriſtians, in ſeverall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:41393:3"/>
of conſcience, if God might but honour me
ſo far as to remove ſtrawes out of the way of their
faith. The moſt of thoſe caſes, herein contained,
were ſuch as in my little time I had gathered
from the experiences of divers; and poſsibly it
was but my duty, to endeavour to ſatisfie them
in my Pulpit, who had almoſt ſet me in my
cloſet. And had not I had their <hi>Imprimatur,</hi>
(ſo much nothing is there of mine in them) they
had never been offered as a Sacrifice at another
Altar. If God hath ſanctified them but to one
ſoul, I dare not call them <hi>common</hi> or <hi>unclean.</hi>
If what hath ſatisfied my own, and poſsibly
ſome others ſpirits, may be honoured with further
ſucceſſe, let the Phyſician of ſouls have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and I onely more of his work (which is a

eye paſſeth the ſeveral pages, your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
will eſpie ſome ſtone turned out of the way,
upon which your <hi>Honours</hi> own ſoul ſtumbled.

ſought to enter line theſe plain Sermons with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

knew, leaves of antiquity, would make no plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

the ſmell or look, but the inward vertue of the
ſalve, which muſt heal the ſores of a troubled

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader, eſpeciallie ſuch an
one as walks with a troubled Spirit.</head>
            <p>FOr thy ſake (Dear Heart!) were theſe Sermons
compoſed, preacht, and now made publike.
The world (this day) abounds with treatiſes,
and excels former times in the Spirituality of the
penmen, who have written powerfull, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.
Some there are that have made it their work
to <hi>Plant:</hi> Theſe have led ſouls up the ſtairs to Ieſus
Chriſt, ſhewing them the way to the land of Glory;
ſuch have been our <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> with divers
others. Others God hath ſet to build, and as he uſed
the other chiefly as his porters, ſo he ſeemeth to have
uſed theſe as the Grooms of his chamber, &amp; appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to ſet out the excellency of the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, to them that are ſick of love: Theſe have led
ſouls from chamber to chamber, ſhewing them all
the chambers of <hi>free grace,</hi> and making it their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
work, to ſet out the Bridegroom in his glory,
and exalt the Riches of free mercy. The work of the
firſt was to dreſſe the Bride; The ſecond diſcover the
Bridegroom in his wedding Robes. A third ſort have
had their work allotted them, to ſhew Chriſtians
how to keep houſe with Ieſus Chriſt: Theſe have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Chriſtians how to walk cloſely with Ieſus
Chriſt; of that number have been our <hi>Bolton,</hi> and
<hi>Burro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghs,</hi> and <hi>Sibbs,</hi> and <hi>Downham.</hi> A fourth ſort
have been Gods <hi>weeders,</hi> making it their work to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
poor ſouls from the ſnares of the Devil, and the
truth of God from thoſe errours which this age
<pb facs="tcp:41393:6"/>
hath brought forth: (And no wonder if in greater
plenty then former times, in regard we have had a
ſummer ſo wet with ſhowers of grace, in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of Goſpel-myſteries, excelling the drineſſe of
former times.) A fifth ſort there have been, (though
a ſcanter number) that have attended upon <hi>Chriſts
hoſpitall,</hi> indeavouring to heal the wounds of bruiſed
ſpirits: In this way have our <hi>Downham,</hi> and <hi>Bolton,</hi>
and <hi>Sedgwicks,</hi> and <hi>Sibbs,</hi> laboured in part. I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to rank my ſelf in the latter number, offering
to thee ſome Receits for the ſtaying of thy ſoul (if
ſick of love) If there be any thing in this Treatiſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to thy ſouls particular wants, Let God have the
glory, and the Author thy prayers: Sure I am, to
ſome of thoſe, (in whoſe ears they were delivered)
they were <hi>As apples of Gold in Pictures of ſilver.</hi> Think
not there is any vertue in theſe lines, they are but as
<hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ſtaff to the face of the dead childe. Poſſibly
thou mayeſt from hence diſcover, how irrationall
the temptations of Sathan are, (if once duly weighed)
Uſe theſe poor meditations with faith, and prayer,
and poſſibly Chriſt may honour them ſo far, as to
make them inſtrumentall for the clearing the way of
thy faith, and eſtabliſhing thy ſouls peace. Truly
(Reader!) it was not my own but others opinion of
them, which hath made them publike. If by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a block out of thy way, they but quicken thy
pace to Ieſus Chriſt, if by removing, or preventing
thy doubts, they adde but a dram to thy faith, it ſhall
be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>crown: if they but diſcover to thee, the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of Gods wayes, (which the Devil, and thy, and
my baſe heart would make rugged) I have my end,
who deſire nothing from them but a giving glory to
<pb facs="tcp:41393:6"/>
God, in helping on the peace of thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>My intention is to make a further progreſſe, I
have ſent this but to uſher the way, and to ſee, if this
age can like any treatiſe, that quarrels not in chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
diſputes, nor ſmells of novelties.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad Age (Chriſtian!) in which we live;
while moſt of our time is ſpent in <hi>Tithing mint, and
Annis,</hi> we neglect <hi>the weightier things of God law.</hi>
Diſputing opinions hath eaten up the Religion of
Chriſtians; we are all too apt to ſpend more time
in examining our Brethrens <hi>Tenets</hi> then in ſearching
our own hearts: How much of our times, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Books, are ſpent in quarrelling for the <hi>Ius
Divinum</hi> of a Church-government, which is but as
the mint and Annis to the weightier things of Gods
Law? (Yet am I not of ſo looſe principles as to think,
The Government of the Church a meer circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
nor can I think that form of Government,
worth taking up in a ſtreet, that for the eſſentials is
not to be found in the word of God, <hi>Iuxta,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſecundum</hi>
are terms I underſtand not.) Every Truth of Chriſt
hath the brightneſſe of a ſtar in its forehead; but of
theſe ſtars, ſome differ from others in glory. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!
thou ſhalt ſee here, a great deal of the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
weakneſſe, but his ſtrength muſt be perfected
in weakneſſe, whoſe work it is to ſtay up the hearts
of them that relye upon him. Search the Scriptures,
ſee if theſe things be true which thou here meeteſt
with; if they be, receive them for truths ſake, and
uſe them as an handkerchief to wipe the tears from
thine eyes. I have endeavoured neither to darken
them with miſty expreſſions, nor yet to paint them
with beauteous vermilion-language: I had rather
<pb facs="tcp:41393:7"/>
they ſhould take thine heart, then thine ear, and be
rather an object of thy meditation, then admiration.
I remember that true ſpeech of <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his Epiſt.
<hi>ad Nepotianum,</hi> inſtructing him how to preach: <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente

ſhouldſt ſo preach in the Church, not that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould be provoked to humming but ſighing;
that the tears of thy hearers, may be the praiſe of thy
Sermon. The Sermon of a Miniſter (ſaith he) ſhould

               </gap>n; I would not have thee like a declamer in
the ſchools, or a brawler, or one that ſhould have a
great deal of expreſſion, without the ſubſtance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but one that ſhould be skild in the Word, and
Ordinances of God. In ſhort (ſaith he) It is the
trick of dunces, to rumble over words, and by their
meer expreſſions, make people admire him: For
there is nothing ſo eaſie, as to deceive a poor unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
people, with a voluble tongue: for they, by how
much the leſſe they underſtand, by ſo much the more
they admire. Thus he. And yet was not this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of our old Cathedrall, and Univerſity Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?
nay is it not yet of many in this City, that have
<pb facs="tcp:41393:7"/>
not left making uſe of the Pulpit, to tell us what they
have of Greek, and Latine Fathers, in their common
place book? A generation of the worſt of men (Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel I ſhould lye to call them) that
go about to convert, and heal ſouls, as the Devil heals
diſeaſes, by charms that the Patient underſtands not.
Their whole deſigne is to make people admire them,
To this end they preach, as if the dayes of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi>
were ſtill continued: The men are <hi>Galileans,</hi> and
their hearers too; yet if <hi>Parthians, Medes, Elamites,</hi>
and the dwellers in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> were there, they
might hear ſomething of their own language, and
ſomething poſſibly that neither the Preacher nor
the hearers underſtand. They are admired, <hi>Verily
they have their reward.</hi> Obſerve how theſe men court
an humme, with their jeſts, and ſpittings; how am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
they are to ſmooth up their ſentences with
an <hi>eſſe poſſe videatur.</hi> Such <hi>Pulpit-monkies,</hi> that bring
the Ordinance of God into contempt, and make the
Word of God of none effect, They may well be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>opprobrium Evangelii.</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord unto
the ſhepheards,<note place="margin">Ezra 34. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Should not the ſhepheards feed the

theſe wretches vend themſelves, the poor hungry
ſoul ſtarves, at meat, crying out, <hi>Death is in the Pett,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41393:8"/>
Theſe unnaturall Fathers, while poor ſouls cry for
<hi>Bread,</hi> cheat them with <hi>Stones,</hi> and while they call for
<hi>Fiſh,</hi> they beguile them with <hi>Scorpions.</hi> My heart
bears me witneſſe, that in theſe following leaves, I
have laboured not to ſmooth, but to ſettle thy ſoul,
which muſt be by putting thee on to truſt in the
Lord.<note place="margin">Iſai. 50. 10.</note> If thou miſlikeſt theſe Sermons for their
plainneſſe, know that I had rather diſpleaſe thy taſt,
and teach thee to rectifie thy pallate, then by ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pleaſe thy childiſh tooth, loſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ſpeaking to many an others heart. Read it;
thou ſhalt not leave it without learning ſomething;
if thou getteſt no good in relation to the intended
end, thou ſhalt learn yet a leſſon of the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
nothingneſſe, and give glory to God, by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to him, and truſting in him for thy ſouls peace.
If from any thing in theſe Sermons, thy ſoul (by the
bleſſing of God) gets any comfort, and ſettlement,
Let thy and my God have the glory, and his ſoul the
benefit of thy tears, and prayers, who is, and ſhall

are but faiths retinue, fed from Faiths table,
and accordingly maintained as Faith is more or
leſſe ſtrong, and able to maintain them. This hath
made the Devil more beleaguer the caſtle of Faith,
then all the other petty holds (comparatively) that
chriſtian maintaineth againſt him: That as the

againſt the Doctrine of Faith. It is a note of <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi>
(as learned an obſerver of hereticks and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,

hereſies about the Doctrine of Faith, then any one

Nor hath he leſſe, but indeed far more malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the practice of Faith; he underſtands well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that it is not knowing and having but acting
Faith, that doth the Chriſtian good. This makes
him do what he can, to perſwade the ſoul to reſt in
a falſe faith, and hinder the ſoul from beginning
to act a true Faith, or darken the ſouls ſence of
Faith; or if all will not do, yet he will turn every
ſtone to hinder the growth, and increaſe of Faith;
that every Chriſtian had need with the Apoſtles

<hi>This I might make good from Scripture, from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

Mar. 9. 24. The Apoſtles pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our

the experience of the children of God is abundant
proof, for every particular. I might alſo give many
reaſons: Firſt, why the Faith of Gods children is
weak. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the state of mortallity is imperfect,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
1 Cor. 13. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe of the inconſtant condition of a</hi>

full moon, in a gracious heart; the ſun will be in the
eclipſe ſometime, and the moon in the wane. Now
we ordinarily beleeve by ſight, it is an hard thing
to make Faith out-run the eye, <hi>Ye have ſeen</hi> (faith
Chriſt) <hi>therefore you beleeve,</hi> Joh. 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another cauſe may be <hi>the multitude of</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>our renewing corruptions:</hi> The bowl of Faith runs
nimbly, if the ground of the ſoul be even, but ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41393:20"/>
long as the ground that it runs on is rugged, we
muſt expect Faith ſhould meet with rubs, and be
a ſhort caſt ſometimes, and ſometimes more home.
Doubts and fears are rubs in the way of Faith, and
all Chriſtians know, that they are the creatures of
mortallity, and the attendants of corruption. There
is a great deal of reaſon you ſee, why the Apoſtles
Faith ſhould be weak, <hi>In many things we ſin all, and
the more we ſin, the leſſe we beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is much reaſon too may be given, why
the weak (if true) beleever ſhould be ſenſible of his
weakneſſe. As,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>If we conſider, that it is his work to be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laying his heart to his eye:</hi> The workman, by laying
the timber to his eye, often ſees, how far it differs
from the ſquare; the Chriſtian, by laying his heart
to his eye, ſees the crookedneſſe of it, and how
much it wants, and the irregularity in the beſt
Chriſtian in not ſo little, but the examining eye
will diſcover it eaſily.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>If we conſider, that as the beleever lays
his heart to his eye often, ſo he lays the ſquare to his heart
alwayes:</hi> The Carpenters eye may deceive him, if
he thinks it doth, he lays the ſquare to it, and that
mends the errour of his eye; The ſquare of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is Gods Word, the Chriſtian lays it to his
heart, conſidering how much faith that requires,
and diſcovering how much diſagreement there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his heart and that, <hi>Pſal. 119. 105. Thy word is
a light to my feet, and a lanthern to my paths,</hi> Pſal. 19.
11. <hi>By the judgement of the Lord, David was made
circumſpect.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if we conſider <hi>that the Chriſtian is not ſelf-opinionated:</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41393:20"/>
He cares not for falſe glaſſes, and is more
apt to behold his graces in a diminiſhing then a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
glaſſe; the ſincere Chriſtian concerning
himſelf, is as ready to miſcall a mountain a mole-hill,
as the hypocrite is to misjudge every mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill
a mountain; almoſt as ready to miſcall his good
evill, as the other to nickname his evill good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the third Branch of the Doctrine,</hi> That
as it is the duty of Chriſtians to be ſenſible and groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the defect of Faith, ſo it is their duty (and they
will) not ſtand still but ſtrive and pray for an increaſe of
it, <hi>Much reaſon might be given for that too: As,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the nature of the ſpirit of God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and dwelleth in them: <hi>Faith is the ſpirits work,</hi>
1 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>Fleſh and blood never revealed it. Now
the ſpirit</hi> is a quickning ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. It is life,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
               <p>Now where there is a principle of life, there will
be growth: <hi>It is a working ſpirit,</hi> that phraſe we have
often, <hi>The ſpirit which worketh in you, &amp;c.</hi> Now the
ſpirits work is not to undo what it hath done, but to
work further and more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we conſider <hi>The end of the Chriſtian</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>in the acting of all his graces,</hi> Phil. 3. 13. The Apoſtle
expreſſeth it fully: Perfection is his butt, he knows
he muſt draw his bow with all his ſtrength, and his
arrow to the head, if he means to reach the butt, and
he ſhall not hit it neither. The Chriſtians voice is,
<hi>Heb. 6. 1. Let us go unto perfection.</hi> It is the hypocrite
ſets himſelf bounds in Religion, and ſayes hither will
I go and no further. And to adde no more,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Chriſtian knows, that the more he hath</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>of Faith, the more he hath of Christ:</hi> he knows that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41393:21"/>
there is a depth of ſweetneſſe in Chriſt, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adomed; ſomething more to be underſtood
when he underſtands as much as he can of him; when
the ſoul hath as much as its narrow hand can graſp
of him, whole Chriſt is too big to be encloſed in
mortall arms: Now the ſoul knows that Faith is
the hand muſt ſqueeze that eſſence of ſweetneſſe, the
arm that muſt claſpe him, and he knows that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
his arm of Faith is, the more he ſhall graſpe of
him, though he ſhall never be able to comprehend
immeaſurable Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. This makes
him alwayes complain of his dwarfiſhneſſe, that his
hand of Faith is not big enough, and his arm of Faith
is not long enough, he cannot get in ſo much of
Chriſt into his ſoul as he would do; this makes
him pray for an increaſe of Faith, and ſo often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the ſhortneſſe of his arm, he cannot beleeve
as he would: This makes him ſay with our Apoſtle
here <hi>Lord increaſe my Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the application: and here is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Conſolation and Exhortation.</p>
               <p>For all Chriſtians,<note place="margin">1. Conſ.</note> eſpecially thoſe that are moſt
ſenſible of the weakneſſe of their Faith. There have
been and are more dwarfs beſides thee Chriſtian;
Perfection is a white was never hit, the beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

at which every one ought to levell his arrows, but all
the ſouls of Chriſtians, like the arrows of <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
have flown, <hi>ſome over into glory, ſome ſhort, ſome on this
hand, ſome on that,</hi> none hath hit the mark. Be of good

Chriſt hath his arms full of tender ſucking lambs,
or at leaſt, that were ſo upon the earth. The youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
Chriſtian, if he be an heir, is of age to take up
his land in heaven, nonage is no bar. The Garden of
God hath more ſlips then old ſtocks in it, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are become ſtocks, but here they were

but a weak Faith, in compariſon of that perfection
we ought to aſpire to, and that it is the duty of

againſt it? Let us all then look upon it as our duty;

               <p>Now here many directions might be given.</p>

                  <hi>The firſt I will give ſhall be to remove thoſe things

               <p>The removing of which, will not a little conduce

to make it my work, in theſe Lectures to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
doubting Chriſtians in caſes of conſcience, and

at which the Devill bends ſo much of his force and

               <p>Therefore wouldeſt thou grow in Faith,<note place="margin">Direct. 1.</note> remove thoſe
ſcruples which hinder the beginning and progreſſe of
Faith in thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>There are two notes of a weak Faith, in a gracious
ſoul.
<list>
                     <item>1. A ſence of no Faith.</item>
                     <item>2. A fear of a falſe Faith.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A ſence of no Faith.</hi> Many a ſoul doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that perſwades it ſelf it neither doth nor
ought to beleeve; you ſhall often meet with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and eſpecially in the beginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
that will cry out, <hi>O they cannot beleeve, nay
what have they to do to beleeve?</hi> Faith were but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in their ſoul if they could hatch it up: Or
if not ſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Yet you cannot make them think that they
do beleeve, no, Faith and they are ſtrangers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now as it is in the diſeaſes of the body, the cure
is ſcarce wrought untill the cauſe be firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and removed; ſo it is likewiſe in the troubles
and diſquietments of the ſoul, we ſhall ſcarce be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to remove them out of the ſouls way, unleſſe we
firſt finde how they came there, and if we can but
truely underſtand the cauſe we ſhall eaſily remove
the effect.</p>
               <p>In generall, we muſt know theſe complaints are
to be underſtood concerning the Acts of Faith. <hi>I
dare not, or cannot, or do not [beleeve] that is, apprehend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41393:22"/>
and apply, and reſt upon Chriſt as my Saviour.</hi> We
ſpeak not of Faith as it is an infuſed habit, and the
gift of God to us, but as it is an inherent grace, and
operative in us. Now then we will,
<list>
                     <item>1. Enquire what the cauſes of ſuch complaints
in gratious ſouls may be.</item>
                     <item>2. We will conſider, how to ſatisfie the ſoul in
ſuch troubles and ſcruples.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt complaint, <hi>I cannot, I dare not reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Chriſt and beleeve in him:</hi> There are many cauſes
of it which I ſhall ſpeak to.</p>
               <p>One ordinary cauſe of it is,<note place="margin">Scrap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſouls to much eying
of preparatory qualifications.</hi> I do not ſay the ſouls <hi>eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
but the ſouls <hi>too much eying</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that if you ask a poor ſoul under that
trouble, whats the reaſon thou dareſt not reſt thy ſelf
upon Chriſt? Faith is a pretious flower, that grows
as well in the pooreſt beggars, as the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
garden: The meaneſt arm may as boldly lean on
Chriſts ſhoulder, as that which is gayed with gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
<hi>Alas</hi> (ſaith ſuch a poor ſoul) <hi>Gods juſtice proceeds
according to method: Firſt, he uſeth to pull down, and
then to exalt; Firſt, to lay the ſoul low licking the dust,
then to ſay to it, I am thy ſalvation. Alas, I was never
enough humbled! I never ſaw hell yet; would God rend
my heart in pieces, I could beleeve he would bind it up;
would he humble me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in order to the ſatisfaction of a ſoul under

               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether humiliation goeth before Faith, or no.</item>
                  <item>2. If it doth, what may comfort a ſoul under this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of ſpirit, and what it ought to do in relation to its

For the firſt, it is a queſtion variouſly toſſed, and
determined, underſtood, and concluded in theſe
times, in which God hath caſt our lot; ſome utterly
denying any ſuch work, ſome too eagerly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for meaſure, ſome limitting Gods dealings, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
misinterpreting, if not wilfully miſtaking, the

               <p>

or Repentance before Faith.</p>
               <p>Now for the fuller determination of it, I ſhall

and prove it by Scripture and Reaſon, And laſtly,

               <p>Firſt, I will ſpend a little time to open the terms,
which (when rightly explaned) I am confident will

both in the kinde, and in the act. There are divers
kinds, and divers acts of Faith. There is an hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Faith, which conſiſts onely in the knowledge
and aſſent to the truth of an Hiſtory, There is a
Faith of miracles, There is a temporary Faith, and
there is a true juſtifying Faith. The queſtion is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be underſtood of the latter, which hath alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Acts. Firſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Secondly, Relyance:
Thirdly, Perſwaſion. The queſtion is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of the ſecond Act, <hi>Whether God gives the ſoul
power, comfortably and truely, to relye upon Chriſt, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41393:23"/>
the promiſes for ſalvation, before he hath wrought repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the term <hi>Repentance,</hi> is ſubject to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
too. Repentance is ſometimes taken large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the whole work of converſion, and ſo Godly
ſorrow is an effect of it; ſometimes ſtrictly; and
when we ſpeak of Repentance in the queſtion, we
onely underſtand the firſt parts of it, conſiſting in
conviction, contrition, and humiliation, by which
the ſoul is carried out into a loathing of it ſelf, both
for its ſins, and in its righteouſneſs: And the queſtion
is, <hi>Whether God doth not work in a ſoul, a ſorrow of heart
and loathing of it ſelf for ſin, before the ſoul hath power
to reſt upon Chriſt, for ſalvation, and relye upon him
as its Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt ſafely underſtand what is alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
meant by <hi>going before:</hi> Firſt, we do not underſtand
[by going before] <hi>a precedency in Gods hidden operation;</hi>
he at once infuſeth the habits of grace into the ſoul:
But ſecondly, by going before, we underſtand <hi>a going
before in a gratious Act,</hi> and <hi>in a comfortable apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Neither farther is the queſtion to be underſtood,
as if we thought Humiliation went before Faith, as
a <hi>work wrought by our own ſtrength.</hi> We acknowledge
Humiliation to be <hi>a work of Gods ſpeciall grace in the
ſoul.</hi> And the queſtion is plainly thus,</p>
               <p>Whether God ordinarily gives a poor ſoul power to act
Faith, by relying upon Chriſt, and the promiſes of life
and ſalvation, before, in ſome meaſure, he hath brought
the ſoul to be ſenſible of its loſt and undone condition?</p>
               <p>We ſay he doth not.</p>
               <p>We will grant to our Brethren that are unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
concerning this truth,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41393:24"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That a man must beleeve, before he can mourn:</hi>
But how? not by any ſaving act of juſtifying Faith.
He muſt beleeve there is a ſin-pardoning Saviour,
that hath fulneſſe and freeneſſe of mercy, and enough
in his fulneſſe for him; and that, though he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.
Then <hi>he puts his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may
be hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly, we will eaſily grant,</hi> that a man muſt
have ſaving and juſtifying Faith, before the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and humiliation will be perfect in his ſoul:
<hi>As we maintain it to be a precedent work, ſo we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
it not to be a ſubſequent effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we will grant, that <hi>it is not a work to be
done by our own ſtrength,</hi> it is Gods work, onely our
diſpute is concerning Gods uſuall order in working.
The ſame ſpirit that works a power in the ſoul of
dependence upon Chriſt, takes alſo <hi>away the heart of
ſtone, and gives an heart of fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we will grant, <hi>that the habits of theſe
graces are both together in the ſoul.</hi> We onely queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which God gives the ſoul power to act firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, <hi>We diſpute not concerning the meaſure, but
concerning the thing.</hi> We do not queſtion, whether
the ſoul muſt be thus far, or thus much, or thus long
humbled, before God will give it power to act
Faith, by a comfortable reliance on Chriſt. We
onely ſay it muſt be humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, <hi>We do not limit the workings of God, and
ſay it is ſo neceſſary on Gods part, that he cannot give the
ſoul power comfortably to apply Chriſt and the promiſes:
but we ſay, it is not his uſuall courſe and ordinary may of
diſpenſing grace, to do it.</hi> Yet his dealings are various,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41393:24"/>
he works not alike to all; he may, and ſometimes
doth go out of his beaten road. The queſtion is not
concerning a neceſſity on Gods part, but onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a neceſſity on our part; not concerning his
miraculous power, but his gracious will; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any extraordinary operation, but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his ordinary way of diſpenſations. This is the
queſtion truely ſtated, which I ſhall endeavour to
maintain as a truth of God, in this following po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>That God in his ordinary way of diſpenſations of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Grace,<note place="margin">The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſtated.</note> doth not give a poor ſoul power to apprehend
Chriſt, as its Saviour,<note place="margin">The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> and accordingly to reſt and relye
upon him for ſalvation, before in ſome meaſure or other
he hath brought ſuch a ſoul to be ſenſible of its loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by Nature, and humbled it for its going a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ray
from him.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall labour to make good, From Reaſon,
Scripture, and Experience; and clear from thoſe
Objections, and Arguments, brought againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The ſoul cannot come into Chriſt, till it be gone</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>out of it ſelf, nor can the ſoul know that Chriſt is come
into it, till is knows it is gone out of it ſelf.</hi> The reaſon
of the latter is plain, for it is impoſſible the ſoul
ſhould know that to be which cannot be. But Chriſt
cannot come into a full ſoul. Now the ſoul is not
gone out of it ſelf, not will it go out of it ſelf, till it
ſee the danger of continuing in it ſelf; this danger
works fear, this fear ſorrow, and this ſorrow is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt will onely come into ſuch a ſoul, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
give ſuch a ſoul power to reſt, and relye upon, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to apprehend him, as will prize him. But till the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41393:25"/>
ſoul be humbled, it will never prize Chriſt.</hi> For the
firſt, that Chriſt will onely come into ſuch a ſoul
as hungers and thirſts after him, it is plain by the
many promiſes made to ſuch. But that ſoul that is
not emptied of it ſelf, it is impoſſible but it ſhould
loath Chriſt, according to that of the wiſe man,
<hi>Prov. 27. 7. The full ſoul loatheth the honey comb.</hi> The
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To you that beleeve he is precious.</hi> If
Chriſt be not precious to the ſoul, the ſoul doth
not, will not, cannot, beleeve in him. Now ſo long
as ſin is ſweet, and luſt ſweet, how ſhall Chriſt be
ſweet to the ſoul? Is Chriſt and ſin both of a taſte,
think we? <hi>What fellowſhip hath light with darkneſſe?</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle) If Chriſt be precious to them
that beleeve, then certainly ſin muſt be bitter to
them that beleeve, if light and darkneſſe be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. But Chriſt is precious to
them that beleeve.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>That ſoul can never be willing to reſt upon
Chriſt, that is not willing to leave ſin, for ſin and
Chriſt are contrary:</hi> and it is impoſſible for a man to
pleaſe his luſts and Chriſt too, <hi>You cannot ſerve God
and mammon.</hi> Now it is impoſſible that the ſoul ever
ſhould leave ſin (which is naturall unto it) and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Chriſt, (whoſe goodneſſe and ſweeneſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then nature, more then fleſh and blood
muſt reveal) before it be convinced, that ſin is vile
and bitter. A reaſonable creature is acted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
principles. <hi>Nabal</hi> could ſay, <hi>Shall I take my
bread, and my water, and my fleſh, that I have killed, for
my ſhearers, and give it unto men whom I know not what
they be. Who is</hi> David? <hi>and who is the ſon of</hi> Jeſſe?
(ſaith he) The figtree in <hi>Iothams</hi> parable ſaith,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41393:25"/>
                  <hi>Shall I forſake my ſweetneſſe and my good fruit? and go
to be promoted over the trees.</hi> So ſaith a poor ſoul
when it is proud, who is Chriſt? and who is the
Son of God that I ſhould leave all? Sacrifice my
luſt and my corruptions unto him? What! (ſaith
the proud ſinner) ſhall I forſake my ſweet luſt and
ſweet corruptions, to yeeld to Chriſt? The ſoul
muſt be convinced that ſin is evill, yea, and the
greateſt evill, or it will never imbrace good. Now
it is impoſſible that the ſoul ſhould be really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that ſin is the greateſt evill, and God the
greateſt good, but the ſoul will be grieved, that it
hath forſaken the fountain of living waters, the
greateſt good, to cleave to the greateſt of evils. But
why ſhould I dive into the diſpenſations of God, by
the bucket of reaſon? Let us ſee what Scripture
and experiences of the Saints of God, recorded in
Scripture, tell us, <hi>Mat. 21. 32. And ye when you had
ſeen it, repented not afterward that you might beleeve:</hi>
A learned and pious commentator <hi>[Zuinglius]</hi> hath
this note upon this Text, <hi>Grace and mercy exhibited to
the world in Chriſt, is not eſteemed by thoſe who do not
feel their ſins and grieve for them.</hi> Chriſt complains
in the Text, that they would not repent that they
might beleeve, not that they would not beleeve
that they might repent. Will you know <hi>to whom the
promiſes are made, for whom Chriſt comes,</hi> and <hi>to whom
he comes.</hi>

certainly, if Chriſt Jeſus onely came into the
world for ſuch, and none can have any aſſurance that
Chriſt came to ſave him, till he hath diſclamed his
own righteouſneſſe, and is convinced he is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
loſt creature, Surely then they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
before, for Faith is the uniting grace that
knits the ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the promiſes onely belong to ſuch as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirſt, as are weary and heavy laden, and do not
belong to them before they are ſo, then certainly they
cannot beleeve before they are weary and heavy laden.
<hi>For the ſame inſtant that the ſoul beleeves, and is
married to Chriſt, the ſame inſtant are the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
intailed to the ſoul, being its proper jointure,</hi>
Gal. 3. 22. Eph. 1. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the bleſsing onely belong to ſuch, ſurely
they muſt be ſuch before they can act Faith, or elſe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
may be in the ſtate of condemation, and under the

               <p>Infinite Arguments might be drawn from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
Shall we ſee a little experience. Let us ſearch
out Gods ordinary dealings, to whom hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
himſelf in any comfortable apprehenſion?
what beleevers can we finde in Scripture, who in

Let every Chriſtian examine his own experience,
whether ever he ſhould have received, or prized
Chriſt, if he had not firſt been ſtrucken with the
ſence of his own miſery. Enough hath been ſaid for
it, let us hear a little what can be ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Obj.</hi> No man will be humbled except he beleeve
what ſhall make me run to God and mourn, except I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he will pardon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not diſpute of any Faith, but a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
Faith. To beleeve, and be perſwaded I may
be pardoned, is not a diſtinguiſhing act of a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith, this was granted before; tis one thing to
beleeve I may be pardoned, ſo may an hypocrite,
Tis another thing to beleeve I am pardoned, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
on Chriſt for pardon, this is proper to a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
perſon, nor can he beleeve he is pardoned till
he is humbled.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Repentance is the effect of Faith, now the
cauſe must alwayes go before the effect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We diſtinguiſhed before of Repentance:
Repentance hath two parts. The averſion of the ſoul
from ſin, and the converſion of the ſoul to God;
the latter part of it is onely an effect of Faith, the
former part of it, the turning of the ſoul from ſin,
is alſo an effect, but not onely an effect, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
before Faith, though it be not ended till our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41393:27"/>
life be at an end. Secondly, The turning of the ſoul
from ſin, and the imbittring ſin to the ſoul, is an
effect of Faith, or rather a conſequent of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi>
a generall common Faith in the beginning, but not
alwayes a conſequent of ſaving juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Obj.</hi> Chriſt must work this humiliation, or it is
good for nothing: now if Christ be in the ſoul working
humiliation, then there is Faith: Therefore Faith muſt
go before humiliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, Though Chriſt work this humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the ſoul, yet it doth not follow that Chriſt is
in the ſoul, for it may be a work of common grace,
and Chriſt is not in every ſoul upon which his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace works. But ſecondly, to anſwer more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I am of the minde of Maſter <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Hooker,</hi> that although there be an humiliation
which is indeed the work of common grace, which
an hypocrite may have, yet there is an humiliation
which is the work of ſpecial grace, and that this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
precedes the exerciſe of Faith: And although
it is true, that Chriſt cannot be in the ſoul, but in
the ſame inſtant the ſoul is in Chriſt, for Faith is
the marriage grace, yet it doth not follow, that the
ſoul is inabled by an act of Faith to apply Chriſt
to it ſelf, aſſoon as Chriſt is in the ſoul, and the
habit of Faith is infuſed into the ſoul; and therefore
the queſtion is ſtated, not concerning the habit of
Faith, but concerning the act of Faith; <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God gives the ſoul power to receive, relye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and apply Chriſt, or receive any comfortable
apprehenſions of Chriſt, and the ſoul in reſpect of
us (who can onely judge of the habit by the act) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid to have Faith, before it hath acted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41393:27"/>
or repentance: The queſtion is not which
the ſoul muſt have firſt, in reſpect of Gods gift,
but which it acts firſt for our apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Obj.</hi> The preaching of this puts ſouls upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

they cannot finde that they are ſo humbled as God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſun muſt not be hid, becauſe it
hurts fore eyes: What is the truth of God muſt
not be concealed, becauſe wicked men and ſeducers
grow worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul that is elected can diſpaire, if

death unto death: To the Gentiles fooliſhneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We do not ſay, they muſt repent to ſuch
and ſuch a degree, mourn ſo many tears; we diſpute
not how much ſorrow there muſt be, but maintain
there muſt be ſome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, True ſorrow ought not to hinder Faith,
for the end of it is onely to bring the ſoul to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to exerciſe the grace of Faith, by comming to
Chriſt, reſting and relying upon him for ſalvation,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Obj.</hi> But God works not his acts of ſpeciall grace
after the manner of men, he works them together, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith and repentance are together wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We diſpute not how God works them, but
how the ſoul acts them, not which is in the ſoul firſt,
but which appears out of the ſoul firſt. <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>
may be twins, and in their mothers womb toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but ſhall it therefore follow that they ſhall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41393:28"/>
come out together? may not <hi>Eſau</hi> put out his hand
before <hi>Iacob,</hi> and be ſeen firſt by the mother and
world too?</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Obj.</hi> But this is to take away free grace, to ſay
God will not ſave a poor creature before it be thus and

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is not to take away the freeneſſe of
grace, but to teach men to take heed, that they do
not turn the grace of God into wantonneſſe; it does
not deſtroy free grace, to enjoin qualifications and
conditions of Gods own making.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may as well ſay it deſtroyes free
grace, to ſay, none ſhall be ſaved but thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
which is the expreſſe language of Scripture,
<hi>He that beleeveth not is damned already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Free grace is eſtabliſhed hereby: For,
1. Is it not free grace to give a ſoul Chriſt, if it
will but mourn and be humbled and beleeve? is it
not a free gift to give a kingdom unto me, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I will throw away a knife, with which I was
about to cut my own throat? 2. We do not ſay,
that this humiliation and precedent ſorrow, doth
deſerve any ſuch free grace for the performance of
the action, therefore the grace is ſtill free. 3. We
ſay, that free grace works this humilation, a man
can as well break a rock, as break his own heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the work of this powerfull ſpirit, and the ſpirits
operations are free, even like the winde that blows
where it liſteth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. We exalt free grace, and
make it yet more free; onely we would not have
men turn the grace of God into wantonneſſe to their
own confuſion, and therefore their vain obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that this brings us again under the covenant of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41393:28"/>
works, <hi>(do this and ye ſhall live)</hi> falls in pieces of it
ſelf; for we neither hold that it is in the power of
any creature to do this, to break his heart and
mourn for ſin, nor yet that any ſhall merit any ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by doing of it: we abhor that doctrine of
merits, that God juſtifies either for any works
of grace acted of our own, or for the merit of any
graces which he hath infuſed into us.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Obj.</hi> But when the Iaylor asked <hi>Paul,</hi> what ſhall
I do to be ſaved? he doth not ſay, mourn and be ſaved,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> faſt and pray and be ſaved, but beleeve and be ſaved;
and when we read of the converſion of <hi>Lydia,</hi> we do
not read, that ſhe had any ſuch humiliation as theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galliſts
talk of, the text onely ſayes, that God opened the
heart of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To that of the Jaylor, it is true, that
<hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, mourn and be ſaved, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> had
learned more wiſedom then to afflict the afflicted;
the Text ſayes, <hi>He came trembling and fell at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
feet.</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſeeing him thus ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with terrour, bids him <hi>beleeve,</hi> and though he
knew not what to do, yet he might be ſaved; and
how this proves that there is no need of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let the diſcreet reader judge, becauſe when
the Jaylor was ſo terrified that he was ready to dye,
<hi>Paul</hi> doth not bid him ſtill be humbled, but beleeve,
therefore there is no need of humiliation. It is
plain out of the Text, that his humiliation although
it was ſudden and ſhort, yet it was ſtrong: Firſt,
It made him tremble and fall down at the Apoſtles
feet: Secondly, it wrought fully to its appointed
end, to beat the ſinner out of himſelf, Sirs! ſaith he,
<hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41393:29"/>
implied, for if he had known what to do, he would
never have askt, <hi>what ſhall I do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome will ſay his trembling and falling
down, was for fear the priſoners were gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is cleared out of the Text, <hi>Paul</hi> had
cried unto him, <hi>Do thy ſelf no harm for we are all here,</hi>
after all this cometh his trembling, and crying,
<hi>what ſall I do?</hi> But ſecondly, we may ſhape ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anſwer to it, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Jaylor, only <hi>beleeve
and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> beleeving doth here include
humiliation, <hi>Faith is an act of an humbled ſoul,</hi> and
no ſoul will or can beleeve, that hath not been truly
humbled; therefore the great hurt that thoſe do,
that preach down humiliation under a pretence of
preaching up Faith, is dealing too deceitfully with
peoples ſouls: Firſt, <hi>Preaching onely Faith,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Perſwading them that a ſinner as a ſinner, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
whoremunger, &amp;c. is the ſubject of Faith,</hi> and
not a ſinner as an humbled ſinner. For the example
of <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Eunuch, which is all, that there is
any pretence to boaſt of; We anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God opened her heart without any knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
is eaſier for us to denye then for them to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, (ſaith Maſter</hi> Shepheard) <q>Theſe were
examples of ſouls converted unto God before, who did
beleeve in the Meſsias, but did not know that this Ieſus
was the Meſsias, which they ſoon did when the Lord

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 
                  <q>In examples recorded in Scripture <hi>(ſaith</hi>
he) of Gods converting grace, do not think they had
no ſorrow for ſin, becauſe it is not ſet down in all places,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41393:29"/>
and quoteth, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13, 14. Paul</hi> was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
but the Lord received him to mercy, doth it follow
therefore he was received without humiliation? ſee the
contrary, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods works are not alwayes alike</hi> in all,
therefore in ſtating the queſtion: I put in <hi>(in Gods

in a fiery charriot, but every one muſt not look to

               <p>And now I leave every Chriſtian reader to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,

ſo it is in this complaint of the ſoul, here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of truth, as well as ſomething of miſtake, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what the complaint is grounded; that therefore
no ſoul might preſume from what I ſhall ſpeak by
and by, not to oil up a preſumptuous ſoul, but to
eſtabliſh a fainting ſoul, Let me premiſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a truth, and that which muſt ſtand
if all the world be found liers to it, That God ſeldom or
never gives the ſoul power to apprehend and apply Ieſus
Chriſt, and truly to reſt upon him, before that he hath
firſt of all ſhewed the ſoul its loſt and undone condition.</hi>
God makes humiliation to act firſt in the ſoul, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of our ſight, and hence are the promiſes made,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41393:31"/>
not to ſinners as ſinners, but to ſinners as humbled
ſinners, I mean, that God hath humbled and
brought low. I proved this ſufficiently the laſt time.
Chriſt came <hi>to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt:</hi>
not to <hi>call the righteous but ſinners to repentance.</hi> I
ſay this is a truth, and we muſt grant it, yea, and we
muſt grant too, that it is according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſpenſations of his grace; and if any come to
heaven another way, it is beyond Gods ordinary
courſe of dealing with ſinners, for this is his uſuall
courſe, firſt, to throw down to hell, then to lift up
to heaven, and a rule muſt not be caſt away for one
exception, nor a ſummer made with one ſwallow.
And therefore let no ſoul preſume, and ſay, well I
can beleeve and reſt upon Chriſt, and yet I never was
humbled; without queſtion where is a falſe apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and a falſe reſting upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and there are ſome that pretend they reſt upon Jeſus
Chriſt, to whom Chriſt will be as a bruiſed reed,
and as a broken ſtaffe another day: See it plain,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 20, 21. But on the contrary, there may be
and is a great miſtake upon this truth, in troubled
and fainting ſouls: And therefore I ſhall in the next
place apply my ſelf to them, to offer ſomething by
way of conſolation to them, to ſupport and ſtabliſh
them, and by way of ſuccour to them, to ſtrengthen
them againſt this temptation of Sathan. For Faith
is the radicall and fundamentall grace of the ſoul,
and as he ſaid to his ſouldiers, <hi>Fight not against either
ſmall or great, but onely against the king of Iſrael</hi> (He
knew if he were over thrown, his army would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

his Faith, and ſtave him off from the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41393:31"/>
I ſhall eaſily overthrow his ſoul; <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not is condemned already;</hi> but if he gets that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
he is ſafe: therefore I ſay, to throw the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
ſnares out of the way, I ſhall offer ſomething
to ſouls whoſe complaint is this, <hi>O I cannot, I
dare not beleeve,</hi> I have not been humbled enough,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Be comforted, knowing that although God hath
every where called for humiliation, and ſorrow of heart
for ſin, yet he hath no where ſet a meaſure for it.</hi> The
promiſes are not made to ſinners as ſinners, (as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians,
and Libertines, tell us) they muſt make
us a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

promiſes; but it is as true on the contrary, that
they are not made to ſinners juſt thus far, and thus
deeply humbled. That there muſt be ſome, God hath
revealed that in his word; but for the meaſure of it,
God will have that to order and diſpoſe as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.
Be comforted (Chriſtian) that never man was
damned for degrees of grace, for want of grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a ſoul hath periſhed, but for degrees of grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

God will not be tract in his goings, who hath

they are like the way of an Eagle in the air. Now
God hath many wiſe ends in the variety of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations
of his free grace: There are ſeverall
ſorts of people, that God deeply humbles often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As</hi> 1. Thoſe that he intends for ſome great ſervice in

that they ſhall come out, and become witneſſes for

               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Such as God perhaps ſees, have quick and high

layeth them low, that they may have their ſpirits
tamed, and be brought into a lowly ſubjection to
Jeſus Chriſt; And this might be one cauſe of <hi>Pauls</hi>
humiliation too, deeper then any other of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
we reade of.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Such as have been notorious publick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

muſt be cut, and the man ſaved; juſt ſinking in hell,
then lift up by the chin; he had been a perſecutor,

and that might be another reaſon of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſo deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
               <p>4. And yet, <hi>In theſe the wayes of God are not the
ſame to our eye. Peter</hi> an eminent preacher, yet we
reade of no ſuch humiliation in him. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
a grievous devil-poſſeſt ſinner, and yet we reade of no
ſuch ſorrow in her: God will not be tract in his ways,
we muſt not know the manner of his workings with
his Saints, he will chuſe whom he liſt, and why he
liſts, and he will bring them in how he liſts, and
when he liſts, <hi>Eccl. 3. 11. No man can finde out the work
of God, that he maketh from the beginning to the end.</hi>
Gods wayes are like the wayes of a ſerpent upon a
rock, and although think with M. <hi>Shepheard,</hi> that
we cannot conclude, becauſe we do not reade of the
like humiliation of <hi>Lydia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> and others of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
therefore they had no ſuch humiliation as <hi>Paul;</hi>
Yet I cannot but think, that therefore their ſorrows
are not revealed, that we might not ſtumble upon
them, and tye up God to ſuch and ſuch diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as if God could work but one and the ſame
way.</p>
               <p>5. Beſides, <hi>There may be a cauſe in the temper and
variety of diſpoſitions, upon which God makes his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
grace glorious.</hi> God hath ſome that are rough
pieces of knotty timber, theſe he hewes, and cuts
much before he makes them fit for his Sanctuary:
Others of more genuine, and meek, and ingenuous
tempers, would be chopt in pieces, if ſo much
ſhould be hewen off them. Some grounds need not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41393:33"/>
ſuch ſtubbing, and digging, and plowing, and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they will be fit to receive the ſeed without ſo
much labour.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Some diſpoſitions are not ſo fixt, as to ſettle long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an object, as to be ſo deeply affected with it, as others
are.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Moveable diſpoſitions (ſaith Doctor</hi> Sibbs) <hi>are
not long affected with any thing, and therefore</hi> (ſaith

                  </q> And in ſuch a

the ſoul too heavily, <hi>Iſai. 57. 16. For I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for ever, neither will I bee alwayes wroth, for the
ſpirits ſhould then fail before me, and the ſouls which I
have made.</hi> Be comforted (Chriſtian) when thou
conſidereſt the variety of Gods diſpenſations,
though thou doeſt not finde him acting in ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
to thee, as poſſibly he hath done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
It may be he hath not appointed thee for ſuch
an eminent ſervice, he intends not perhaps to call
thee to martyrdom; Poſſibly thou wert by nature of
a dejected melancholly ſpirit, and more indiſpoſed
to pride, then others; Perhaps he had not ſuffered
thee to run into ſuch outragious wickedneſſes, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did, for which they muſt pay more tears to
his bottle? Poſſible thou wert not of ſo moroſe and
rugged a temper, as others; that thou didſt not need
ſuch ſtubbing and digging; not ſo knotty, that thou
ſhouldſt need ſo much cutting and hewing; though
thou hadſt as many bad humours as others, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

yet it may be that they were not ſo ſetled, and
putrified by vitious cuſtome; or if they were, yet be
comforted in this, that God acts not with great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and perverſe natures, and proud tempers, and
eminent veſſels, alike. Who art thou to tract the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?
to limit the holy one of Iſrael? and if that

end be wrought, take no thought for the means. <hi>The
ends of humiliation are chiefly theſe two. Firſt,</hi> To
make ſin bitter to the ſoul, to bring the ſoul into a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
and deteſtation of ſin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make the ſoul
in a capacity of acting Faith,</p>
               <p>1. The firſt end, <hi>is to bring the ſoul into a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
and leaving of ſin;</hi> That <hi>Ephraim</hi> may ſpeak
two words, Firſt, What have I done? Secondly,
What have I to do with Idols? Conſider, thou
ſayeſt I have not been humbled enough, how ſhall
we judge that? 1. Hath thy humiliation made thee
to loath ſin? That thou ſayeſt as <hi>Iob 42. 6. I abhor
my ſelf, and repent:</hi> Mark, the end of repentance is
ſelf-horring. Doeſt thou ſay with <hi>David? Pſal. 119.
163. I abhor and hate lying, and every falſeway,</hi> verſ.
104. <hi>And I hate vain thoughts,</hi> verſ. 119. <hi>And I hate
them that hate thee,</hi> Pſa. 139. 21, 22. This is enough,
reſt thy thoughts in it. <hi>Heb. 1. 9. Thou hast loved
righteouſneſſe, and hated iniquity; therefore thy God,
eventhy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſſe
above thy fellows.</hi> That which was there ſpoken of
God concerning Chriſt, is true of all his members;
hath thy little humiliation (which thou thinkeſt is
not enough) wrought thus in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whereas
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41393:34"/>
thou wert a drunkard, liar, ſwearer, unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
a vain proud perſon, a companion of fools,
Now thou canſt ſay, and ſay heartily, that thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, lying, ſabbath-breaking,
vanity, formality, yea, and thoſe that do theſe
things? Why now thy humiliation hath wrought
its end. Why ſhouldſt thou not love righteouſneſſe,
reſt upon Chriſt, apply the promiſes, &amp;c. To ſay
now, I cannot think I have ground to beleeve, is as
much as if one ſhould ſay, when he hath made uſe
of a ſcaffold to build a great building, Alas! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beleeve that I may lay the top-ſtones of my buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
my ſcaffold is not high enough, or it is not
ſtrong enough; when it hath proved it ſelf both
high enough, and ſtrong enough, in holding to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
the work.<note place="margin">

this queſtion, When is Godly ſorrow ſuch as that

                  <item>2. When that which is wanting in grief, is made up

                  <item>3. When after grief, we finde inward peace.</item>
                  <item>4. When after it, we value the grace and mercy in
Chriſt, above all the contentments in the world.</item>
                  <item>5. When it ſprings from hatred, and works true ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt all ſin.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Now (ſaith he)</hi> true hatred is carried againſt
all ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Eſpecially,</hi> againſt thoſe ſins which are
moſt near. Sorrow for ſin proceeds from the affection of
the ſoul, Hatred from judgement, and we ought rather to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41393:34"/>
reſt in our hatred of ſin, proceeding from our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then in our ſorrow for ſin proceeding from our
paſsions: <hi>Conſidering that the fountain of paſſions,
is deeper in men of a melancholy, and reſerved tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
then in others of a quick and chearly temper,
and yet theſe may hate ſin as well as the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>ſecond end of humiliation, is to make us in
a capacity of receiving Chriſt.</hi> Every ſoul is not in a
capacity of receiving Jeſus Chriſt, when the ſoul
is willing, and deſirous to receive Chriſt, then it
is in a capacity of receiving him. And the ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
act Faith, by reſting upon Chriſt, till it be
made willing. Some will ſay, doth not Jeſus Chriſt
work this willingneſſe? yes without queſtion, <hi>It is
he that worketh both to will and to do, according to his
good pleaſure, Phil.</hi> 2. 13. But yet he firſt worketh to
will, before he worketh to do, and before the ſoul
is willing, it is not in a capacity of doing. <hi>Rev. 22. 17.
Whoſoever willeth, let him drink of the water of life,
freely:</hi> Firſt, will, then take, then drink, and yet it
is free. <hi>They ſhall indeed be willing, in the day of his
power, Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. God draws the will, but he
makes us willing firſt, before he gives us power to
receive, and apply Chriſt, which is the act of Faith.
Now God uſeth means to work this willingneſſe,
and that is humiliation. <hi>Hoſ. 5. 15. I will go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to my place, till they acknowledge their offences, and
ſeek my face. In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
Now if thy humiliation hath wrought this effect in
thy ſoul, that thou art now made willing to receive
Chriſt Jeſus, O beleeve, act thy Faith, let thy
meaſure of humiliation never trouble thee, it hath
wrought its end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41393:35"/>
3. I might name a third <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd of humiliation, and
<hi>that is to inhance the price of Ieſus Chriſt to the ſoul.</hi>
Chriſt would not be ſo ſweet, if ſin were not ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Doeſt thou finde this end wrought? that now
Chriſt is more precious to thee then thouſands of
gold and ſilver, more ſweet then thouſands of luſts
and corruptions? That thy heart now ſayes, O that
I had Chriſt, though I had nothing in the world?
That I had the bread of life to eat, and the water of
life to drink, Though I begd my bread, and wanted
water, all the dayes of my life? O that I had the
robes of his righteouſneſſe, to cloth my ſoul though
I went naked! O give me Chriſt, O give me Chriſt,
above all, for all, inſtead of all, or elſe I dye. Here
now be comforted, the end is wrought again, and
thou haſt no ground not to beleeve, becauſe thou
art not enough humbled. The cauſe muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the end, The end of humiliation, is as you
have heard. What ſerves humiliation for, but to
bring thee to it? If thou beeſt already by humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
brought, that thou art grieved for ſin paſt, that
thou hateſt ſin preſent, that thou loatheſt the
thoughts of embracing ſin for the time to come, that
thou art made willing to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt,
that thou prizeſt him above all the earths content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whatſoever; thou haſt no ground, nay thou
ſinneſt in letting thy Faith ſtumble upon this
threſhold.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider, that it is poſſible thou mayeſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
thy ſelf in this point of the meaſure of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
too: The fountain of humiliation is often
ſo deep, that we cannot fadom it; the well may be
deep, though we ſee but a little of it. Firſt, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41393:35"/>
that in thy humiliation, <hi>you muſt meaſure length
and bredth, and all.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Conſider, thou must
meaſure inſide, as well as outſide.</hi> Thirdly, You muſt
<hi>remember it is not done, though it may be done enough
for thee to apply a promiſe, and reſt upon Ieſus Chriſt,
and receive, and apply him to thy ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Many Chriſtians miſtake upon this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Why doeſt thou think thy humiliation is not
enough? They will anſwer you, alas, I was never in
ſuch a depth of amazing ſorrow, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, as I
have heard ſuch and ſuch a Chriſtian was, they were
even in the jawes of hell. My work was a ſlight
work to theirs. Half ſo much broad-cloth, of a great
bredth, will make a ſuit as well, as ſo much again
of ſome that is not half the bredth; the bredth makes
amends for the length of the other. Others, God
hath given them deep ſorrow, but ſhort, perhaps
he hath given thee long ſorrow, but not ſo broad
and deep; there may be as much water in a ſhallow
pond, that is broad, as in a deep well that is ſtraight.
It may be thou haſt been divers moneths, weeks,
years, under thy ſorrow, though it was not ſuch
an heart-rending ſorrow, as others might be. They
had ſorrow that even rent their heart in pieces, but
it laſted not ſo long as thine, before they had joy:
God meaſured out their meaſure in depth, and thinc
in bredth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, <hi>if you will meaſure your humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
right, you muſt meaſure both inſide, and outſide.</hi>
Poſſibly, you judge you are not humbled enough,
becauſe you have not ſhed ſo many tears as others
have, you meaſure it onely in the outſide, alas, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tempers are not ſo diſpoſed to tears as others.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41393:36"/>
Suppoſe two men were wounded, the one bleeds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or little at all, the other bleeds that the blood
ſtains all his apparell, runs down the ſtreets; you
ſee ſcarce a drop of blood come from the other,
but the wound cloſeth; will you therefore ſay, that
the one bleeds not ſo much as the other? nay ſurely
you will ſay, that he bleeds more deſperately, he
bleeds inwardly. The ſeat of humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the heart,
not the eye. Humiliation is not to be meaſured by
wet handkerchiefs; the ſwoln face, is not alwayes
the outſide of a moſt broken heart; poſſible your
heart weeps, your ſoul is ready to burſt with groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
but you want the vent of your eyes, they are
tongue tied. The meaſure of your humiliation for
all this may be greater then the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Poſſibly ſome may ſay, O but can I think
that God requires no more tears? no more ſadneſſe?
for thoſe thouſands of ſins that I have in my life
time committed againſt him? <hi>Conſider therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
that your humiliation is not paſt, when you have
apprehended and applyed Chriſt to your ſouls.</hi> You muſt
reſerve ſome tears for the time to come, you have
humiliation-work after Faith, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Though
the ſeven Devils be caſt out, and <hi>Mary</hi> be ſet by
Chriſt, yet ſhe may waſh his feet with the tears
of her eyes, and wipe them with the hairs of her
head: She may come again, and ſtand behinde him
weeping, you have to do to look upon him whom
you have pierced and mourn. As the man that takes
phyſick, it works before he takes his broth, but
that ſets it working again, and more; So though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you apply Jeſus Chriſt there will be ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
yet your receiving him and reſting upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41393:36"/>
him by Faith, doth not ſtop up your fountain of
tears, you ſhall have a mourning time after that;
ſave an handkerchief to wet then.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, For thy comfort conſider, that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
ought not to be, 1. A ground of Faith, 2. Is
not a ground of acceptation. The firſt will depend
upon the latter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider, thy humiliation is not a ground of
thy acceptation:</hi> Thou art not therefore accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou art thus and thus humbled. If we watch
not our nature (ſaith reverend <hi>Sibbs)</hi> 
                  <q>There will be
a ſpice of Popery, which is a naturall Religion,
in this great deſire of more grief, as if when we
had that, we had ſomething to ſatisfie God withall,
and ſo our minde ſtill runs too much upon works.</q>
If free-grace did not clarifie tears, and the greateſt
ſorrow we could have for ſin, thoſe bitter waters
would be more filthy then the puddles of the ſtreet.
If the blood of free-grace doth not cement a broken
heart and accept it, and merit for it, hell is its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
and portion, for all any merit in it. It is a good
piece of a prayer, <hi>Pſal. 20. 3. The Lord accept thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
or [make far thy ſacrifice] or [turn thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
into aſhes] A broken, and a contrite heart is
the Lords ſacrifice, which he will never deſpiſe,
<hi>Pſal. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 17. But the Lord muſt, 1. <hi>Turn it into aſhes,
2. Make it fat, 3. Accept it</hi>—And therefore this
can be no ſufficient <hi>remora</hi> in thy way of Faith: For
couldſt thou make thy head a fountain of water, and
thine eyes rivers of tears, they ſhould merit no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
heaven is not to be bought with ſighes, nor
art thou therefore accepted, becauſe thou art hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
but even thy humiliation muſt have an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41393:37"/>
otherwiſe God ſhould ſave us not for his
own ſake, and for his Name ſake, (as indeed he doth)
but for our tears ſake, for our humiliation ſake,
for our works ſake; for Chriſtians muſt warily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that God doth not ſave his people and accept
his children for thoſe works, which his own ſpirit
worketh in them: This is a Doctrine of Popery,
who to waſh their hands of the Doctrine of merits
wherewith they are charged, tell us they hold no
ſuch matter, as that a Chriſtian may be ſaved by
his own works, but God gives him grace to work
good works, and for them he accepts, for them he
ſaves. We ſay no, for even the works of Gods ſpirit
of grace, acting in us, are our works, and ſalvation
is not of works, but of grace. And this Evangelicall
leſſon is hinted to us, even in the Ceremoniall
Law; The Lord commands a yearly day of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 16. for the ſins of the holy Place. To
prove this, I might inſtance in all thoſe Text of
Scripture, of which the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<hi>Galatians,</hi> are eſpecially full, and ſo the Epiſtle to
the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which treat concerning the Doctrine
of Juſtification, and clear it not to be of works, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
internall, nor externall, but of grace: But I will
inſtance but in one, <hi>Titus 3. 5, 6, 7. But after that the
kindeneſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the love of God our Saviour,
toward man appeared. Not by works of righteouſneſſe,
which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, by the waſhing of regeneration,</hi> Mark ye, <hi>by it,</hi>
not <hi>for it:</hi> Gods mercy and free-grace, is the ground
of the ſouls acceptation, and therefore conſider
upon what principle thou runneſt, that concludeſt,
I have not yet been enough humbled, for to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41393:37"/>
as if thy humiliation were the reaſon and
ground of Gods acceptation. Indeed we ought never
to think that we are enough humbled, &amp; yet we ought
alwayes to think that humiliation too much, and that
ſenſe of our ſins too much, which hinders Faith; for it
deſtroyes its end. Therefore why art thou thus trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
(Chriſtian) with this conceit, that your Faith is
no Faith, becauſe before it you wept not juſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tears? It is Faiths work, to beleeve and apprehend
the ſouls acceptation before God. Now Gods acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
as you have heard, is never for the ſouls hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation;
and therefore, what ſhould hinder thy
Faiths working, in apprehending thy acceptation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, becauſe thou art not accepted for this
work any more then any other—Nay,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thy humiliation is not a ground of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Thou doeſt not therefore apply Chriſt, becauſe thou
art ſo and ſo humbled. Put caſe, that a great Prince
ſhould be willing to beſtow his ſon in marriage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a poor peaſant; onely (ſaith he) I will make this
term or condition, that when you come to marrie
him, you ſhal come in ſackcloth, to ſhew what ye are;
he ſhal give you a better garment afterwards; wil any
one ſay, that this maids coming to the marriage ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raied
in ſackcloth, is a ground of her ſo rich mariage?
or will any ſay it is a meritorious condition, that ſhe
deſerveth ſuch a match, to come ſo attired? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no, the ground of all is the Princes delight in her;
this is the ground of his taking her to wife, and yet
the King commanded that attire. So the Lord ſaith,
Poor! vild wretch! I will give thee my Chriſt in
marriage, but thou ſhalt come weeping, to ſhake
hands with him weeping for thy ſins; he ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41393:38"/>
take off thy ſackcloth garments. Can any ſay,
that this is either a meritorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, or a ground
of acceptation, or Faith? Conſider (Chriſtian)
wert thou never ſo much humbled, thou couldſt
not ſay, I will therefore beleeve becauſe I am hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
Humiliation is a neceſſary antecedent to
Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

be a ſtumbling block to thee, which cannot be
a pillar and foundation to thee; if thy Faith cannot
ſtand upon it, let it never ſtumble upon it.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the ſecond thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
which was, to propound ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to ſuch ſouls, as were under this temptation,
as might comfort their hearts, and ſtrengthen and
ſtabliſh them: Onely, I beſeech you remember to
whom I have been ſpeaking all this while, not to
hard-hearted ſtony ſouls, but to broken and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
ſouls; not to thoſe that regard not to
get their ſouls humbled at all, but to thoſe that are
humbled, that they can be humbled no more, and
that groan under the hardneſſe of their own hearts;
not to thoſe that preſume to apply their hot boiling
luſts and corruptions, to the blood and wounds of
Jeſus Chriſt, flattering themſelves with a notion of
Faith, and conceiting they do beleeve; but to thoſe
that are humbled, though they cannot have a good
thought of themſelves.</p>
               <p>I would not be miſunderſtood, to have ſpoken
one word to ſlight the work of humiliation, or to
cheriſh that licentious novell Doctrine, that there is
no need at all of it, and a Chriſtian ſhall not need
regard it; but what I have ſpoken, hath been not
for dead men, (what ſhould they do with cordialls?)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41393:38"/>
but for dying, fainting, ſwooning Chriſtians; not
for them that conſider their ſins too little, but for
them that ſo dim their eyes with poring on them,
that they cannot ſee the abſolute covenant of God,
and the free-grace of Chriſt, and lay hold upon the
promiſes of life. There is an extream on either ſide;
the ſober Chriſtian avoids either, and keeps the
mean. So I have done with the ſecond thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<hi>viz.</hi> to propound ſome conſiderations,
which might comfort the afflicted ſoul under this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and ſtrengthen it to reſiſt this temptation:
For without queſtion, as the Devil hath a deſigne
upon many a ſoul, to run it upon a rack of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and carry it on in a blind notion of Faith;
ſo he hath a deſigne upon ſome ſouls, to wrack them
upon the ſands, and ſink them in a pit of deſpair.
The Devils devouring voice to ſouls, is either;
There is no need of humiliation, or, there is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
enough. I come now to the laſt thing
which I propounded, which is, to give ſome directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to ſuch ſouls as are burthened with this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and groan under this temptation, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
themſelves and what to do. I will reduce all
that I ſhall ſpeak, by way of direction, to theſe heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Eye the nature of the covenant, and grace,
and promiſes of God more. Secondly, Eye the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and cauſe of humiliation more. Thirdly, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Eye the nature of God in his covenant more.</hi>
The cauſe of this affliction is Chriſtians too much
eying, and poring upon their ſins, and themſelves;
the penitent beleever ought to have two eyes, one to
look downward, another to look upward. This is
that which <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf with; when he
conſidered his own unworthineſſe, and the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of his houſe, 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 5. Although my houſe
be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure, for this
is my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he maketh it
not to grow. David,</hi> though a man according to Gods
own heart, yet had a wicked houſe, <hi>Abſolom</hi> had ſlain
his brother, rebelled againſt his Father, lay with
his Fathers concubines; <hi>Amnon</hi> had defloured his
ſiſter, &amp;c. Now <hi>David</hi> looking upon this perſonall
unworthineſſe, both of his own perſon, and of his
children, was humbled for it, and in ſadneſſe of
heart ſaith, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo ordered with
God, &amp;c.</hi> Not ſo ordered as it ſhould be, not orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
according to the mercies that I have received
from God: Yet ſee how he caſts up another eye, and
views the covenant of God; yet ſaith he, The Lord
hath made with me an 1. <hi>Everlaſting covenant, 2. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi>
and 3. <hi>Sure, for this is my ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

Gods covenant, and ſay, Although my heart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41393:39"/>
my life, be not ſo ordered with God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my ſoul be not ſo humbled before God; yet
the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and a ſure covenant; the covenant of peace
and grace with my ſoul, was from eternity, and
therefore free and without cauſe in the creature. I
had neither an hard heart, nor a ſoft heart, when
God made that covenant with me, and it is a ſure co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
as God never made a covenant with me for
the ſoftneſſe and tenderneſſe of my heart, ſo neither
will he caſt me off, for the hardneſſe of my heart,
and it is a covenant ordered in all things. He hath
made a covenant with me, as to give me ſalvation, ſo
to give me ſuch an heart as he requires of me, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto my ſalvation; and for this is my ſalvation.
I ſhall not be ſaved for the worthineſſe of my houſe,
nor for the worthineſſe of my perſon, nor for the
tenderneſſe of my heart, but becauſe he hath made a
covenant with me: Here is the ground-work, here
is the cauſe of my ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſtian, eye 1. <hi>The eternity of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
2. The ſureneſſe of the covenant. 3. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the covenant. 4. The particularity of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
God hath not made his eternall covenant at
random, with thoſe ſouls that ſhall be broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and ſhall beleeve: No (ſaith <hi>David) he hath
made with me a ſure, well-ordered, everlaſting covenant;</hi>
the other is <hi>Arminian</hi> and licentious Doctrine.
God hath made a covenant with thee, and an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
covenant with thee, and a ſure covenant with
thee; eye this and ſay, Well, though my heart be not
ſo humbled before God as it ought to be, though my
ſoul be not ſo broken, though my whole man be not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41393:40"/>
ſo ordered, yet God hath made with me in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
an everlaſting covenant, ſure, well-ordered, and
for this is my ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Eye the nature of God and Ieſus Chriſt, in
the diſpenſations of his grace more.</hi> The truth of it is,
the covenant, the eternall covenant that God hath
made with ſinners, is but a declaration of his grace;
but I conceive, there may be a difference concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
between Gods declarations of his grace, and his
diſpenſations of his grace; though that every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of grace be a declaration of his grace, yet
every declaration of his grace, is not a diſpenſation:
Declations of Grace may be generall, Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of grace are particular. God declared his grace
and love to mankinde, when he made that promiſe,
<hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head:</hi> But
now he made a diſpenſation of his grace, when he
gives a gracious ſoul power to draw out its part in
this promiſe. Now doeſt thou ſit troubled, that thy
ſoul is not thus and thus humbled, not enough
brought low, &amp;c. eye the diſpenſations, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
diſpenſations of Gods grace. <hi>Conſider to
whom God hath made diſpenſations of his grace. 1. In
what manner God hath diſpenſed (and revealed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations
of) his Grace.</hi> Sit down and think of the
Saints of God, that God hath dealt out his ſaving
grace too, and thou ſhalt finde them the moſt worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and vile wretches. To <hi>Paul</hi> the perſecuter, the
blaſphemer, ſo hard-hearted, that he could ſpill
the blood of the tender-hearted Saints of God; yet
this <hi>Paul</hi> the Lord humbled, and dealt out his grace
to: To <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> ſo hard-hearted that he filled the
land with innocent blood, that nothing would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41393:40"/>
but a gaole and ſhackles and ſetters, yet this
<hi>Manaſſes</hi> taſted of the divine diſpenſations of grace.
2. <hi>Conſider in what manner God hath diſpenſed his
grace, and revealed the diſpenſations of his grace to theſe
poor creatures.</hi> Indeed I am apt to beleeve, that of all
thoſe Saints in Scripture, not one ſaw Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a weeping eye, &amp; a mourning hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; but yet this
is certain, that God hath not in his word ſet out to us
the like humiliation of <hi>Lydia</hi> as of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the
Gaoler: Though I am of M. <hi>Shepheards</hi> minde, that
<hi>Lydia</hi> was humbled as well as <hi>Paul;</hi> yet I conceive
there are two things that we may gather for a ſouls
comfort, from the holy Ghoſts ſo variouſly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down Gods dealings with thoſe ſouls whom he
hath brought home to himſelf; ſo fully and deeply
expreſſing the ſorrows of ſome, as of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and the Gaoler, and ſo tacitely concealing the
ſorrows of others, as of <hi>Lydia,</hi> or ſo moderately
revealing of them; as concerning thoſe converted at
Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, concerning whoſe humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we have onely this upon record, that <hi>they were
prickt at the heart.</hi> I ſay, I conceive there are two
things that we may gather from it, for a ſouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
under this affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Gods dealings in this particular, are not
alike with every ſoul that he humbleth, ſome more and
deeplyer, ſome leſſe for his own end: <hi>Which I hinted
you before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive, we may gather this from
that various dealing of the holy Ghoſt, in the word
of God, in expreſſing Gods way with his people,
<hi>viz. That it is Gods will that ſouls ſhould not ſtumble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this rock, and ſtick here; we are not yet enough hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41393:41"/>
not thus and thus humbled;</hi> we ought to look for
ſome, but not to ſtick at the want of the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of humiliation, which ſome of the Saints of
God have had. Conſider theſe things Chriſtian!
weigh the reaſon of Gods ſo various dealing with his
converts, and various expreſſions (of his dealing
with them) in his revealed word, and let this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and direct thee, and raiſe thee up: ſay with thine
own heart, My ſoul! why ſhould theſe thoughts hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thee from going on? Gods dealings with all his
converts, is not alike; and God would have in the
ſame even manner, ſurely have revealed the ſorrows
and humiliations of all his children, as of any, if
he would have had me ſtumbled at this, and made
this a block in my way to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eye Gods nature in his promiſes.</hi> Mark how
the promiſes run, whether abſolutely o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally;
and if conditionally, whether upon this
condition, that the ſoul ſhould be thus and thus deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbled. O (ſaith a gratious ſoul) do you ſet me to
eye them? they undo and ruine me, I finde the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of Gods giving Chriſt to my ſoul, run all
upon conditions of hungring and thirſting, <hi>Iſai. 55.

Of being loſt and undone, and this is that which I
ſtick upon. I will anſwer thee in this particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Tis true, ſuch is the tenor of the promiſes, they do
require hungring and thirſting, &amp;c.</hi> Though not as
meritorious conditions; yet conſider, <hi>That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no more then God hath promiſed to giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> See this
<hi>Zach. 12. 10. Ezek. 11. 19, 20. and</hi> 36. 26, 27. Where
God hath promiſed to give that ſame tender, broken,
contrite heart, which other promiſes require the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41393:41"/>
ſoul to have, that doth apply them to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, that thoſe promiſes that ſeem to
require humiliation and brokenneſſe of heart, as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or qualifications (call them what you will) do no
where require ſuch and ſuch a meaſure; <hi>they require</hi>
rem, <hi>but not</hi> menſuram.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>And for thy great comfort conſider; that</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>thoſe originall promiſes, in which God hath promiſed to
give that tenderneſſe and brokenneſſe of heart, which he
ſeemeth to require in other promiſes, as a condition and
qualification</hi> for the ſoul, to whom of due it belongs
to apply thoſe promiſes; I ſay, thoſe promiſes are
abſolute: for this take but two inſtances, <hi>Ezek. 11.
19, 20. and</hi> 36. 26, 27. which are much the ſame.
<q>
                     <hi>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new
ſpirit within you, and I will take the ſtony heart out
of their fleſh, and will give them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> heart of fleſh,
that they may walk in my ſtatutes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> As if he
ſhould ſay, they cannot walk in my ſtatutes, and keep
my ordinances, untill their ſtony heart be gone,
and they have an heart of fleſh. Secondly, They
cannot have this heart of fleſh till I give it them;
And thirdly, I will give it them. Now ſit down
and eye the promiſes ſay thus: It is true God doth
require an heart of fleſh, before I can apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of pardon to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the ſame God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to give it me; and there muſt, there can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be done of me, in relation to that firſt gift God
hath freely promiſed, to prepare me to apply his
ſalvation, and to walk in his ſtatutes, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my heart of ſtone, and giving me an heart of
fleſh, and beleeve, but this, that God will fulfill
this free and abſolute promiſe unto mee. It is thy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41393:42"/>
duty not onely to beleeve that God will pardon thee,
but alſo to beleeve that God will humble thee; and
not to ſtick upon, I am not humbled enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the promiſe, but to ſay, I will labour to apply
the promiſes of ſalvation, and to beleeve that God
will humble me more, and make good (amongſt
others) that promiſe to my ſoul, that he hath made
to his people, that he will take away their heart
of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the firſt direction to
the afflicted ſoul. Eye the nature of God more in
his covenant: Secondly, In the diſpenſations of
his grace: Thirdly, In his promiſes. I come now to
my ſecond direction, and that is,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider the nature of humiliation;</hi> and
this thou mayeſt conſider: Firſt, In its originall;
Secondly, In the manner of the operation of it;
Thirdly, In its end. The two latter I have handled
at large, in my conſiderations I propounded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the ſoul in its affliction; I will but name them.
Firſt, Think that thy humiliation may be as great as
it ſhould be, though not ſo deep as others have been,
it may be it hath been longer. Secondly, It may
have a more inward work. Thirdly, Its working is
not done, it will have a work as long as thou liveſt.
2. Conſider the nature of it, in its end: Firſt, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
that the end of thy humiliation, is but to bring
thee to loath ſin; ſecondly, Leave ſin; and thirdly,
To make thee prize Chriſt. If this be done, it hath
done its work. But this I enlarged my ſelf upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
3. (which ſhould have been indeed firſt) <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the nature of humiliation in its originall, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cauſe,</hi> which is God, <hi>Zac. 12. 10. Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. 20.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41393:42"/>
and ſit down now and ſay, Certainly, God hath a
good work begun in my ſoul, otherwiſe, why
ſhould ſin trouble me at all? or why ſhould I be
troubled, that I am not troubled for my ſin? and
now how unreaſonable a thing is it for me, to ſtart
from applying the promiſes, becauſe, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
I am not enough humbled? It is God that hath
humbled me at all, and it is he that muſt perfect the
work in my ſoul; and ſurely, if he ſees it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
he will work more, and he muſt do it, if
he will have it, for I am not able to humble my
ſoul. Thus far my direction hath reached to help
thee to eaſe thy ſelf, and direct thee what to do in
point of meditation, and conſideration. My third
reacheth thy practice.</p>

to ſuch doubting Chriſtians. Now there
are divers other things, which lye in the ſouls way,
in relation to this alſo; ſome of which I will ſpeak
ſomething to, being ſuch as are more ordinary, and
as I my ſelf have met with, from ſome Chriſtians,
either ariſing from their too curious inquiſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods hidden decrees, or too much poring upon
their own unworthineſſe. For the firſt of theſe, I
ſhall ſpeak ſomething to it at this time.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>Cap. 3.</head>
               <head type="sub">How ſuch Chriſtians may be ſatisfied and comforted,
as think they have no warrant to beleeve, becauſe they
conceive they are not elected, or do not know whether
they be elected or no.</head>
               <p>ALas! ſaith a poor Chriſtian, why do you tell me of
beleeving? Sure I am, none can be ſaved, that is
not elected; I can ſee no ground to make me think, that
God hath choſen me to life, before the foundations of the
world; nay, I am confident God hath not elected me, but
paſt me over in his eternall decree. <hi>Now to this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſpirit, I will ſpeak ſomething: firſt, by way
of promiſe; ſecondly, by way of conſolation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>By way of promiſe.</hi> It is an ill way of curing
ſuch a wound, by breaking truths head, to make a
plaiſter; as the Arminians, Papiſts, and Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians
do. Let me therefore, firſt, ſhew you what the
truth is, and then ſhew you, with what conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in a conſiſtancy with the truth, a Chriſtian ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41393:45"/>
unwarrantably by this ſcruple ſtopt in its way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
may be ſet a going again; and there will
be left an even-path upon the road of truth for
a troubled ſpirit to goe on in its way of beleeving;
and that both ſteadily, <hi>and</hi> nimbly. Know therefore,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a truth, <hi>That from all eternity, God made
choice of a particular and determinate number of perſons,
to ſave them and none other; nor can any be ſaved, but
thoſe who were ſo elected, and whoſoever are ſo elected,
ſhall not fall away.</hi> This is the truth of God, which
muſt ſtand firm againſt whoſoever they be, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay there is no election, or an election at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
(as the Arminians hold) or a ſlippery one,
that is, alterable, (as Papiſts hold) or that it is made
in time, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, It is a truth,</hi> That God never elected any,
becauſe he foreſaw they would beleeve, and repent and
walk holily; but becauſe he hath elected them, therefore
they beleeve, and repent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, It is a truth,</hi> That thoſe that are thus from
all eternity elected, may come to knew, and particularly,
and fully, and aſſuredly to know, they are ſo elected, and
choſen of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay fourthly, It is a truth,</hi> That it is the duty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Christian, to ſtrive to make his calling and election
ſure, to labour to know that his name is written in the
book of life. <hi>It is that which the Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>calls
for at Chriſtians hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay fiftly, It is a truth, <hi>That there are but a very few
elected, and whoſoever is elected, ſhall beleeve, and more
then are elected, neither can nor ſhall beleeve; Many are
called and few are choſen;</hi> and thoſe that are ordained
to the end, are ordained to the means, they are <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41393:46"/>
to good works.</hi> Theſe are thoſe propoſitions
which I deſired to premiſe, and thoſe which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his inſtruments abuſe, to the unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perplexing of poor ſouls. Theſe are (all) the
truths of God, which do and ſhall remain true,
though all the world be found liars; but what of all
this? I know none of theſe premiſes that will
warrant ſuch a concluſion as this, <hi>Then I have no
ground to beleeve, except I knew that I were one of thoſe
few, whoſe names God hath written in his book of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
The Papiſt, and Arminian, and Libertines, now
take another courſe, to cure the perplexed ſpirit, and
make no bones of it; to ſtay a truth, to heal a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
To this end, they have deviſed ſuch charms to
hang about the necks of ſick ſouls, as theſe are,
<hi>There is no ſuch matter as any decree of election, or God
elects us for foreſeen works;</hi> and if there be an election,
it is not particular, but the decree is entered thus at
randome, in the Court rolls of eternity. <hi>All that
beleeve ſhall be ſaved,</hi> without a particular entrance
of the number, or names, as if God had not ſaid, <hi>I
know thee by name;</hi> and if there be any elected, they
ſtand upon ſlippery ground, <hi>Elected names may be
blotted out, or added in;</hi> as if Gods book were more
blotted then a Mercers ſhop-book. Or if there be
any elected, yet, <hi>it is impoſsible to know that I am ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
nor can I have any aſſurance of my manſion-houſe
in glory, till I have taken poſſeſsion of it.</hi> But this is
to bruiſe the head, for a plaiſter for the heel. On the
contrary, another generation maintain, election to
be the object of Faith, and ignorantly maintain,
<hi>Faith to be the eye of the ſoul, reading its name written
in Gods book, from all eternity, an apprehenſion of our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41393:46"/>
particular election, &amp;c.</hi> But, as theſe do unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wound tender conſciences, ſo the other are bad
chirurgions to heal ſuch wounds. If I miſtake not,
we ſhall finde cordials enough to refreſh ſuch ſwoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſpirits, without buying them at ſo dear a rate,
as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale of a dram of pretious truth. Therefore
leaving theſe premiſes, to be held and maintained,
as the ſure pillars of eternall truth, I come in the
next place to propound ſome conſiderations that
may comfort and ſatisfie poor ſouls, thus unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
troubling themſelves, <hi>[ſalva veritate Dei]</hi> the
head of truth yet remaining without a wound or
ſcar. That is my next work, and to that end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Thou ſayeſt,</hi> If I knew I were one of thoſe that
God had elected, then indeed I had ſome ground, in order
to my ſalvation, to relye upon the promiſes; but unleſſe
I be elected, ſuch reliance will be rather a fond and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
preſumption, then a warranted and well-grounded
Faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider, (Chriſtian!) <hi>That Faith is not
an apprehenſion of particular election, but an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of generall promiſes.</hi> Thou art miſtaken (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground) in the object of true Faith, Chriſt
calleth upon all, to whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
is preached,<note place="margin">Iſai. 55. 1. 2.</note> in his Goſpel,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 7.</note> to beleeve. <hi>He, every
one that thirſteth, come, and buy. Iohn</hi> was ſent <hi>to
bear witneſſe of the truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>that all men through him
might beleeve,</hi> Joh. 6. 29. Chriſt layeth it as a duty
upon all the people, <hi>That they ſhould beleeve on him
whom God had ſent.</hi> Now can we imagine, that the
meaning of Chriſt was, that they ſhould beleeve,
that all of their names from eternity, were in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41393:47"/>
Court-rolls of eternity. The Goſpel obligeth all
that hear it, to beleeve; but doth the Goſpel lay
an obligation upon any, to beleeve a lye? Faiths
object is the promiſes of the Goſpel of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. It is Faiths work in the ſoul, not to cloſe
with the decree of God, and to boſome that, but
to cloſe with the promiſes, and imbrace them. It
is Faiths work, to eye Chriſt, in a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
through the proſpective of a promiſe, not
to eye Chriſt, as the ſouls faviour, through the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of Gods predeterminate purpoſes, <hi>Heb. 10. 23.
Let us hold faſt the profeſsion of our Faith, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 23</note>
well, but upon what grounds, the next words
tell us, <hi>For he is faithfull, that hath promiſed,</hi> the <hi>ſure
word,</hi> not the <hi>ſure decree</hi> of God, is the object of our
juſtifying Faith. Now, where hath God left thee
ſuch a line of promiſe, as this? <hi>Thou ſhalt be elected
to glory,</hi> or, <hi>I will elect thee to glory.</hi> God hath ſaid, I
will pardon, <hi>I will heal, I will eaſe you;</hi> and theſe
words, God calls thee to reſt upon, as ſure and
faithfull words: God hath ſaid, <hi>He that beleeveth on
the ſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>hath everlaſting life;</hi> but he hath never ſaid,
<hi>He that beleeveth in my decree, hath everlaſting life.</hi>
Indeed, if our election were that which were to be
the firſt thing to be beleeved: it were ſomething to
ſcruple a Chriſtian, and it would be enquired into
how we ſhould know that we are elect; for it is
neceſſary, that we have ſome certainty of knowledge
of that which is to be beleeved, that it ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
to us; but there is no ſuch matter. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are our object,
which not being particular, but generall, make our
way ſmooth; As for example, we have a promiſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41393:47"/>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever beleeves in him, ſhall not periſh
but have eternall life.</hi> This promiſe now, it is thy
work to beleeve, <hi>viz.</hi> that beleeving in him, <hi>I ſhall
not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Doeſt thou ſay,
how ſhall I know this promiſe is made to me? what
ground haſt thou for that queſtion? when as in the
promiſe, <hi>there</hi> is no reſtriction, <hi>Whoſoever beleeves.</hi>
The writing runs, <hi>To all perſons to whom theſe preſents
comes,</hi> what ſhould they do? beleeve in the <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi>
reſt and relye upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>for
eternall life.</hi> The generall promiſe is by thee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to be applyed. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are
weary and heavy laden</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I will eaſe you.</hi>
This is now thy duty, to come unto Chriſt, but
ſayeſt thou, I cannot come, I do not know I am ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
Chriſtian, does Chriſt ſay, <hi>Come unto me all
you that are elected, and I will eaſe you?</hi> No he ſaith,
<hi>Come unto me all you that are weary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 29.</note> Suppoſe a man
had an intention to give to ſuch a particular number
of perſons, ſuch a quantity of money, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
with himſelf, to give to none other but thoſe,
yet ſhould make a Proclamation, that whoſoever
came to him acknowledging their poverty,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he
would relieve, in the mean while, ſecretly with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
determining,<note place="margin">☜</note> not to give a penny to any, but
thoſe whoſe names he had in his book, and who
ſhould come; and knowing that none of the reſt
would come, but be too proud to come and take it,
were it warrant enough for any to refuſe coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſcore? <hi>I hear he hath made a book, and though
he makes a generall offer, yet he will give but to a few
perſons, and for my part I do not think I am one of
them. If he wil ſend me word, I am one of thoſe whoſe name
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41393:48"/>
is in his book, I care not though I go.</hi> It is thy caſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,

elected? fear leſt for this cauſe <hi>ſalvation</hi>
be denyed thee. But ſo much for the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, <hi>That thy election cannot be
known to thee, till thou doest beleeve.</hi> Papiſts ſay, It
cannot at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> known aſſuredly to thee, till thou
comeſt to ſee thy name in heaven thy ſelf; but that
is falſe; but this is truth, that till thou doeſt beleeve,
thou canſt never know whether thou beeſt elected or
no. The eternall decrees of God, are only demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us <hi>[a poſteriori]</hi> from the effects, who hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up unto heaven at any time, to ſearch the
records of eternity?</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>All that is recreated of God is by the Son, Ioh.
6.</hi> 46. No man hath <hi>ſeen the father ſave he which is
of God, he hath ſeen the father.</hi> Nor can any thing be
known of the father,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 27.</note> but by the Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27.
Now, where hath the Son revealed the fathers ſecret
decrees any where? when there was but a queſtion
concerning the time of thoſe great things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 36.</note>
                  <hi>Mat. 24. 36. ver.</hi> 1. Chriſt tells them, <hi>ver. 36.
Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no nor the Angels,
nor the Son,</hi> Mark 13. 32. <hi>but the father onely.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Son as man, did not know Gods ſecrets ſo
far, or whether (according to <hi>Aquinas) ideo dicitur
neſcire quia nos ſcire non faciet,</hi> he therefore be ſaid
not to know, becauſe he will not ſuffer us to know,
I ſhall not diſpute, either of both will ſerve our turn;
Gods particular decree of election, is a ſecret, lockt
up in the boſome of him who is the auncient of days,
of which, either Chriſt himſelf [as man] was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41393:48"/>
or concerning which (to be ſure) he was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
as ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er to reveal his fathers thoughts; he was
indeed (as God) the Privy-counſellor of eternity,
but a ſecret keeper of his fathers thoughts, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
as well as an obedient Son to his commands
in revealing his fathers will: Chriſt indeed tells his
Diſciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>He had choſen them,</hi> but it was though, not
becauſe they beleeved that he choſe them yet after
that he had called them, and they were come to him,
and had walked conſtantly and obediently with him,
that he told them ſo. Chriſt hath not revealed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
election to any before Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nor <hi>ever will be.</hi> Will Chriſt think
you ever reveal the ſecrets of eternity to thoſe that
actually are his utter enemies? Election is one of
Gods ſecrets; it is the roll wherein the eternall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
betwixt this or that particular ſoul, and the
King of eternall glory, is written, and inrolled:
Now the Scripture indeed ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſecret of the Lord
is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his
covenant.</hi> But hath the Scripture ever ſaid, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the Lord are with unbeleeving damned wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
for (he that beleeveth not is damned already)
no, when the ſoul is once called, and beleeves on
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then God in his due time
reveals the ſecrets of eternity to ſuch a ſoul, and
puts it on ſpectacles to reade the particular cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that he hath made entred, and enrolled in the
court of heaven, which is written in ſmall and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
characters, and cannot be read but with enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
eyes guided by the eternall ſpirit. Beſides,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider <hi>the phraſe of Scripture,</hi> how it
doth reveal to us our <hi>particular election. Peter</hi> calls
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41393:49"/>
to them, to <hi>Strive to make their calling and election
ſure.</hi> Firſt your calling, then your election, 1 <hi>Ioh.
2. 5. and</hi> 3. 6, 10.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 5.</note> It is the conſtant language of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">3 Ch. v. 6. 10.</note>
and the ſenſe of all the Apoſtles, that by our
Faith, and fruits of our ſanctification, which are
the conſequents, and attendants upon Faith, We
muſt know, whether we be in God, or no; whether
we be the ſons of God, or no; our particular electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt be known to us by the effects; doeſt thou
therefore ſtick at this? I muſt know that I am ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
otherwiſe I cannot beleeve, thou cutteſt off
the means by which thou ſhouldſt attain to thy end.
Thy end is to know thy election. Now the means by
which thou ſhouldſt attain to this particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and aſſurance, muſt be Faith and the fruits
of it: This thou caſts off, a thing ſo abſurd that thou
wouldſt condemne it in any worldly matter. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">3 Con.</note>
                  <hi>Conſider thou hast no ground for thee to thinke thou
art not elected, unleſſe it be thy unbeleefe.</hi> God hath
made open Proclamation: <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth in
him ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life: Whoſoever
commeth unto me, I will in no wiſe turne him away.</hi> Let
all come, and I will eaſe you. Suppoſe a King ſhould
make a Proclamation concerning ſome Malefactors:
<hi>Let every one that will, come to me and beg his pardon, and
he ſhall have it.</hi> Though he hath a ſecret reſervation of
thoughts in his boſome to pardon none but ſuch and
ſuch, becauſe he is confident the reſt will be too
proud and ſtout to come; yet upon what juſtifiable
ground ſhall any Malefactor think the King intends
not to pardon him before he comes to him and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
begs his pardon: Shall he ſtand, and at a diſtance
ſay, Let the King ſend me a particular pardon, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41393:49"/>
then I will come for it and thank him; but till I am
ſure he intendeth to give it, I will never take the
pains to go. Upon what grounds ſhall ſuch a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
think the King intends not to give him his life?
hath he not good cauſe to think his ſtoutneſſe is the
cleareſt and proximate cauſe? God ſaith come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
and you ſhall live; Thou ſaith now, no, I do
not think I ſhall live, let me know that, and then
I will beleeve; what ground haſt thou to think thou
ſhalt not have the end, but becauſe thou wilt not uſe
the means? Suppoſe a man lay very ſick, his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
ſhould preſcribe him ſuch and ſuch means,<note place="margin">☜</note>
in order to his recovery; no not he, he remembers,
<hi>His time is in Gods hand, and he cannot paſſe it,</hi> he is
ſure, he will ſee firſt whether God will let him live,
or no, and if God will ſend him a leaſe of his life,
then he will uſe means. Suppoſe now ſuch a man
ſhould dye, what might any think the cauſe why he
dyed ſo ſoon? What? the period that God had ſet
to his dayes? or his own refuſing the means to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
his life? But this will be further enlarged in a
fifth conſideration.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider but this, <hi>That all thoſe whom God
hath elected, he hath not onely elected to the end, but to
the means.</hi> Gods eternall decree of election, is not
entred thus in the Court-book, <hi>Be it ordained, that
ſuch or ſuch a perſon ſhall live eternally:</hi> But, be it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
<hi>That ſuch or ſuch a perſon, ſhall in time be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and beleeve the Goſpel, and walk holily like one of
my children, and after receive the crown of glory.</hi> We
were predeſtinated, <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of
his glory,</hi> Eph. 1. 12. and 2. 10. <hi>For we are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
created in Ieſus Chriſt unto good works, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41393:50"/>
God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi>
God hath ordained the means, as well as the end, and
you muſt firſt know by your calling and beleeving,
that you are elected to them, before you can know
you are elected to eternall life; the ſame God that
hath made it a decree of eternity, this and that man
ſhall be ſaved, hath alſo made it a decree, that this
or that man ſhould beleeve. Beleeving that I am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and one choſen of God to eternall life, is a
piece of ſenſe, not of juſtifying Faith (ſaith learned
and pious <hi>Rutherford)</hi> and it is a piece of ſenſe too,
to think I beleeve, as I have at large heretofore
ſhewed, but it is an higher thing, to beleeve and be
fully perſwaded that I ſhall infallibly be ſaved, then
to think I truely beleeve, it is a ſtep higher; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
is plain, becauſe no Chriſtian can think
that he ſhall be undoubtly ſaved, unleſſe he thinks,
firſt, that he doth truely and ſavingly beleeve. Now
therefore thy firſt work muſt be to get a ſenſe of
Faith, to beleeve that thou beleeveſt; for thou wilt
never know that God hath ordained thee to life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
thou firſt know that he hath ordained thee to
beleeve, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 9. For God hath not appointed us to
wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
that is, by beleeving in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are ſaid <hi>to be elected in Chriſt,</hi> that is, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſalvation in Chriſt, and by beleeving in Chriſt,
which is the true ſenſe of that place, <hi>what ever Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
wreſt it for.</hi> But I paſſe on to a ſixth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, Conſider,</hi> That by ſtanding at this ſcruple,
thou doeſt not onely ſinfully, and unwarrantably, and
endieſſely perplex thy ſelf, and hinder thine own ſouls
peace, but alſo thou calleſt in queſtion gods wiſdom, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41393:50"/>

in queſtion Gods wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>God in his wiſdom hath thought it fit, that his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
election of any ſoul to eternall life, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from it till it hath beleeved,</hi> to let Faith go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

know I am elected, and then I have ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving;
God ſaith, beleeve, and then <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt
ſee, and this is the way of his wiſdom with ſouls;
thou ſayeſt, no, let me ſee, and then I will beleeve;
God ſaith truſt me, I will be faithfull; thou ſaiſt,
no, I will not truſt thee a jot further then I can ſee
thee.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>God in his wiſdom hath thought it a ſufficient
ground for a ſoul to beleeve in him, and truſt to him, that
in the promulgation of his Goſpel, he hath ſhut none out
of heaven, that have not ſhut out themſelves.</hi> Thou
ſaiſt, no, I will know whether God hath ſhut me out,
before God ſhall know whether I will ſhut out my
ſelf, or no; God judgeth it moſt fit, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſhould ſpeak firſt, and tell him, whether he will
accept of his grace tendred, or no; thou ſaiſt no, but
I will know firſt, whether God that hath made his
large tenders of grace, will make good what he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
nay, thou ſtandeſt upon Gods ſeal, as if thou

               <p>Secondly, Nay, herein <hi>Thou ſlanderest his charters of
free-grace,</hi> Thoſe ſay, <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth ſhall live;</hi>
thou ſaiſt, in effect, no, for if I be not elected, nay, if
I do not know I am elected, I can have no ground to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41393:51"/>
beleeve; what doeſt thou but ſlander the charter of
free-grace; as invalid and inſufficient, and good
for nothing? and is it fitting that the creature ſhould
thus deal with the Creator?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>If thou wilt but beleeve, nothing that is in
Gods decree, ſhall or can hinder thee of ſalvation:</hi> The
whole Goſpel runs in this language,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16, 36. and 6. 40, 47. and 11. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
in him ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life.
He that beleeveth on the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi> Lay
thy damnation, Chriſtian, to Gods charge, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
thou periſheſt. <hi>O Iſrael</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is of thy ſelf.</hi> Never fear it Chriſtian, God will
waſh his hands and clear his word to, of thy blood,
or any ſinners in the world; The righteous Judge of
the whole earth, will do no unrighteous action, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall any falſhood proceed out of his lips, <hi>He is
not as man that he ſhould lye.</hi> Thou ſhalt never, nor
ſhall any damned creature ever ſay, if the thred of
Gods word had not broke, I had not faln into this
pit. Thy damnation ſhall be of thy ſelf, not of him,
nor for any fail of his faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider, <hi>Heaven and glory are not ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
things, but they are worth adventuring for, if
thou hadst but a poſsibility of obtaining them, though
thou hadſt no certainty.</hi> Thou ſaith, except I were ſure
God had elected me, to what purpoſe ſhould I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?
unleſſe I be pre-ordained to ſalvation, it is
impoſſible I ſhould be ſaved. Chriſtian! haſt thou
ſo cheap and low thoughts of heaven and glory? a
vain ſtudent, that hath but heard of ſuch a thing, as
a Philoſophers ſtone, which they ſay hath a vertue
in it, to turn other metals into gold, he hath but
heard that there is ſuch a thing to be found out, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41393:51"/>
perhaps doth but fancy ſuch a thing findable, with
the expence of much time and ſtudy, and money;
he upon this conceit, lays out a great deal of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
expends a great deal of time, thinks no time
too much to ſpend, no money too much to be expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to try a concluſion, he hath no certain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
perhaps of ſuch a things poſſibility; however,
no certainty, that he hath found out the very way of
finding it; perhaps, he hath many diſcouragements
from divers that have ſpent their eſtates, buſied
their brains, loſt abundance of time, and yet never
could finde it, yet he goes on carried on with a ſtrong
fancy, hoping not to fail. Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> when ſhe
went into the King, had no certainty of finding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
yea, ſhe wanted not ſome diſheartnings, in
regard of a cuſtome in the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that none
ſhould come in to the King, till they were called,
and yet more, ſhe had not been called of thirty
dayes: (an extraordinary time) Yet ſee her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
her buſineſſe was extraordinary, many lives
depended upon her venturing her life, ſhe puts on
a gallant reſolution to go in, and ſaith, <hi>If I periſh I
periſh,</hi> and God bleſſed her enterprize, and ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the holding out of the golden Scepter, and
the anſwer of her deſire. Thou ſaith, <hi>I am not ſure
I am elected;</hi> I ſay yet, <hi>beleeve,</hi> Thou art or mayeſt
be ſure, if thou doeſt beleeve, thou ſhalt live; thou
haſt the word of God for it, It is but the expence
of a little time in praying, hearing, faſting, &amp;c. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was their one experience of one, that beleeved
and was damned, to diſhearten thee; God calls thee
to it, if thou doeſt not, not the lives of others but thy
own ſoul is in danger of periſhing; God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41393:52"/>
the golden Scepter, Heaven and Chriſt, are
worth venturing more for, then thou canſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Go in, reſolve to reſt upon Chriſt, do it true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and my ſoul for thine if thou periſheſt. Thus
I have ſhortly indeavoured to ſpeak ſomething, how
little ſoever, and in how much weakneſſe ſoever,
to poor ſouls pleading this bar to Faith; Conſider
of it, you ſee this ſtill remains the great work of a
Chriſtian to obey Gods revealed Law, not to ſearch
into his ſecret will: Hear O man! what God hath
required of thee, <hi>Beleeve and be ſaved,</hi> make not
blocks in thine own way. Art thou weary and heavy
laden? come unto him that ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all
you that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you:</hi>
Ah! but (wilt thou ſay) I am a poor vild unworthy

free-grace. Oh, that ſinners had but as willing leggs
as he hath capacious arms; we ſee hands are waſhed
every day, and have been theſe thouſands of years,
now how long can we think it would yet be, ſhould
we get the dirtieſt hands we could make, before all
the ſeas, rivers, fountains, and ſtreams in the

ſhould waſh ſeven times a day? infinitely ſooner
(Chriſtian) then the fountain of free-grace ſhall be
exhauſted, with all the buckets that come to draw
the water of life from it. Seeſt thou a ſteeple, as

were another on the top of that, there would not be a

thou? it is hardly credible, but ſuppoſe that
free-grace hath not (ſo far as thou canſt finde) any
where ſet a ſtamp of love upon a ſoul ſo actually
wicked as thou art before God; Yet ſecondly, <hi>There
is never a Saint this day in glory, that was not as ſeminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

conſideration, which will hang upon a chain with
this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>If thou couldſt ſuppoſe that infinite free-grace,
never yet did ſo great a work, as to waſh and ſave
ſuch a ſinfull ſoul as thine is, yet this could not in reaſon
be a juſt hinderance to thy Faith; becauſe, the depth of
infinite love and free-grace, was never yet ſounded.</hi>
Though thou couldſt truely ſay, God never mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
his power and good will, in pardoning ſuch a
creature of hell, as I am; yet what would follow?
Therefore God cannot pardon me, or therefore
God will nor pardon me: Did ever God do his
utmoſt, Chriſtian? thouſands of thirſty, filthy
creatures, ſince the world began, have been bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their buckets, and diving into the infinite
depth of eternall love, but did ever any <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi>

<hi>Paul</hi> brought as large a bucket, as any, and
had as much need of a great meaſure of free-grace:
Well, he plungeth himſelf in, but doth he dive to

which is this.</p>

&amp;c. why I am not worthy of ſalvation, I am a
great ſinner, I have been an auncient ſinner. Well
then, ſuppoſe that thou never hadſt to thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
committed actuall ſins, but wert (as thou
thinkeſt) clean, and ſpotleſſe, then thou couldſt come
to Jeſus Chriſt, and think he would accept of thee.
<hi>Thy money periſh with thee;</hi> doeſt thou think that
Chriſt, <hi>that gift of</hi> God, can be purchaſed with the
money of thy merits? Doth Chriſt take any ſouls,
becauſe they are worthy? or doth he therefore take
them, that he might make them worthy? doth
Chriſt therefore take a filthy mired ſinner, becauſe
it is unclean? or that he might waſh it from it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe?
God <hi>gives</hi> his Son, thou miſtakeſt if thou
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41393:59"/>
thinkeſt he can be bought of thee, either for love,
or money? canſt thou make Chriſt rich with the
coblers ends of thy righteouſneſſe? thinkeſt thou he
that hath the inexhauſtible treaſury of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
doeſt thou think he cares for thy farthings?
wilt thou bring thy drops to the bottomleſſe ocean
of his bloody merits? <q>
                     <hi>Your penny-worths cannot
roll about that everlaſting wheele of free-grace, the
decree of election, nor bow, nor break Chriſts free-heart
to ſave you more then another.</hi>
                  </q> The Garden of
free-grace (Chriſtian) hath never a weed of humane
merit in it; no nor yet is there a ſpace to ſet it in.
The Robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is rich, and full
enough, and needeth not the dunghill patches of thy
merits? That new-cloth will not endure to be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with thy old rags. Chriſt is a Noble-Bride-groom,
that would take a portion with his ſpouſe,
if ſhe could bring a proportion for him; <hi>Adam,</hi> if
he could have got it up, might have been married
to God with a dowry. But for as much as now that
cannot be, perfection is not attainable. Chriſt
ſcorns thou ſhouldſt ſay, Thou haſt brought him a
farthing. The men of the earth ſhall not make him
rich. The firſt marriage-contract God made with
man, he demanded a portion, and proffered the
jointure of glory: But when man with all his ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
could not pay it, Come, ſaith Chriſt, I will
take thee with nothing then. <hi>Do all,</hi> or <hi>take all,</hi> is
Chriſts Dilemma to the children of men.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider, <hi>That by how much the greater and
more abominable ſinner thou art, by ſo much ſhall the
Lord Chriſt attain his ends more fully which he aims at,
in ſaving any ſouls.</hi> Doeſt thou ask what that is? It
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41393:59"/>
is his own glory, the glory of his free-grace. God
when he declares his free-grace to any ſoul, makes a
particular Proclamation, Come, let all the world
ſee the power of my mercy, and the good will that
is in my bowels, that I can waſh ſuch a ſtained ſoul
that is nothing elſe but ſin, that I will pardon ſuch
an old inveterate ſinner; Now by how much thy ſins
are more and greater, by ſo much God more ſets
out the vertue of his balm, in healing ſuch old pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
ſtinking wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God knows, ſuch ſinners once pardoned and
changed, will more glorifie him. <hi>They that have much
forgiven,</hi> will love much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſhall have glory from ſuch a ſinner, in

caſe, be not afraid, as yet there remaineth hope of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I will undertake for thee with Chriſt, I will dye for
thee if need be, as Chriſt dyed for us, I will hazard my
ſoul for thine, truſt to me, Chriſt hath ſent me.</hi> He hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this, ſtood ſtill, trembled, and wept, embraced
Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and wept bitterly. The Apoſtle, when
he had promiſed, and proteſted to procure pardon
for him of our Saviour, prayed upon his knees,
kiſſed him, and brings him to the Church, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him, faſts with him, and leaves him not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

he knows not how to deſtroy thee; he weeps

am ſure, the ſin againſt the Holy-ghoſt ſhall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and I and confident that very ſin have I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I have ſinned againſt light and knowledge, I have

               <p>Now to the ſatisfaction of a poor ſoul under this

               <p>Firſt, By way of Premiſe, <hi>It is a truth that there

ſuch a ſin, called by Chriſt, <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghoſt,</hi>

and that the ſin againſt the Holy-ghoſt, is a ſin of

<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 6, 7. For whoſoever ſins the firſt way, ſins

are not to be meant of every blaſphemous word, but
there is <hi>(quadam blaſphemia &amp; quoddam verbum)</hi> a
certain word, and a certain kinde of blaſphemy:
Now what this is, that we are in the dark for, nor
have any (except the Papiſts unwarrantably) dared
certainly to define or deſcribe it, ſo as to ſay, This is
the unparponable ſin; Now therefore, Chriſtian,
upon what ground doeſt thou ſay, <hi>Thou haſt ſinned the
ſin againſt the Holy-ghoſt,</hi> when neither thou nor any
other can ſay, this or that is the ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghoſt?
why doeſt thou accuſe the ſoul of thou

yielding to a groundleſſe temptation. But
ſaith a poor Chriſtian, <hi>I have refuſed the enlightening

and what is this, but the impardonable ſin? or have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

againſt knowledge, ſuch and ſuch a truth I have
denied, diſputed againſt it, &amp;c.</hi> To make therefore
a little progreſſe, though poſitively it cannot be ſaid,
nor ſpecifically determined, what the ſin againſt the
Holy-ghoſt is, that is unpardonable (for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that every ſin againſt the Holy-ghoſt, is not
unpardonable; A lye againſt knowledge, is a ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Jacob committed it for the bleſſing:) Yet,</p>
               <p>1. It may be ſhewen negatively, what it is not.</p>
               <p>2. Severall ingredients may be diſcovered, that
muſt be in this compound of iniquity. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to thy complaint conſider,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That none can be guilty of it, but ſuch as
have had a great meaſure of knowledge of Gods truth,</hi>
Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. They muſt be ſuch as have been <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,</hi>
that is, ſuch as the Goſpel hath been
preacht too, and receive by, ſo that it hath cleared
up his underſtanding from that darkneſſe and miſt
of naturall blindneſſe, and ignorance, in which
<hi>Adams</hi> fall left us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Such as have taſted of the heavenly gift,</hi>
that is, <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pareus)</hi> ſuch as having heard the
word, have not onely been convinced of it, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a firm aſſent of Faith to it; for it can onely be
underſtood of a temporary Faith of aſſent, not of
true juſtifying Faith, for that in whomſoever it is,
<hi>is kept by the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such as have taſted of the good word of God,</hi>
Such as have had the Goſpel preacht to them, and
have apprehended it good and ſweet, received it with
joy;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Heard it gladly</hi> (as <hi>Herod) Heb.</hi> 10. 26. They
muſt be ſuch, as have received the knowledge of the
Truth; It muſt be a defection, and a declination
from knowledge, and a profeſſion, as is clear from
that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. from whence is plain, that
a naturall man that never was enlightned, or an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
that never heard the word of God, or thoſe
that though they have heard, yet have not had hearts
to regard and received what they hear, and give aſſent
to it, Theſe cannot be guilty of this unpardonable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41393:64"/>
ſin; why doeſt thou therefore trouble thy ſelf, that
<hi>thou hast refuſed the Goſpel, and therefore thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the ſin againſt the Holy-ghoſt,</hi> When the Goſpel
was never made known to thee, ſo far as to enlighten
thee? poſſibly thou heardſt the word, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoodſt
not, regardeſt nothing. Thoſe that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Chriſt, were converted at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
have thine ears been ſtopt to the means of grace? be
humbled for it, but diſpair not becauſe of it, though
thou beeſt called at the ninth hour, yet if thou wilt
come in at the eleventh, thou ſhalt be received, and
welcome, onely come. God winked at the time of
thy ignorance,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. This ſin muſt be againſt
the word, heard, received, taſted, &amp;c. It is not a bare
piece of originall corruption, conſiſting in a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of knowledge, or averſeneſſe unto knowledge,
or vanity of heart in not regarding knowledge; but
it is the higheſt piece of actuall rebellion, not for a
while to ſtand at a diſtance from a pardon offered,
but to begin to reach out an hand to take it, and then
draw back, and ſpit in the face of that God that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
thee; This is plain, for it is a blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy-ghoſt in his workings; now the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
doth not alwayes work with the preaching of the
word, much leſſe is the law of nature the work of
the ſanctifying ſpirit: But the work of illumination
and ſanctification, thoſe are the ſpirits works, in
which we muſt take heed of oppoſing him. This ſin
is not petty-iarceny, but high-treaſon againſt God.
But <hi>alas! will a poor Chriſtian ſay, yet I fear, for I have
received and taſted the word of truth, and I have made
a ſhew of rejoycing in the good word of God, and after
this have I been in my heart, thinking to deny Christ to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41393:65"/>
be the Saviour of the world, to deny the word to be the
word of truth,</hi> and ſinned againſt knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Therefore conſider, <hi>This ſin which is the
unpardonable ſin, muſt be a ſetled ſin of thy own, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in without repentance, and will be more then a ſin of
thy heart.</hi> That it is firſt begot in the heart, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſin is, is a truth, but it goeth out of it; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
is properly committed with the tongue,
without queſtion, the heart, and tongue, and hand,
have all a portion in this ſin unpardonable, but it is
not in the thought onely: Beſides, 2. <hi>It may be thy
blaſphemous thoughts, which thou hast in thy heart, are
none of thine own;</hi> for ſuch thoughts there are oft
times in a Chriſtian, that are meerly caſt in by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
into the ſoul, neither bred in, nor nurſed by the
ſoul, nor delighted in, but are like the childe that
was dead, laid (by the true mother) by another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
ſide. It is a little queſtion, whether theſe
thoughts be ſins, or no, if ſpurned out, and rejected
by thee? whether they ſhall be put upon thine, or
upon Sathans ſcore,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by moſt of our divines.</note> to anſwer for? It is by all gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that if they be ſins, they are the leaſt of ſins;
as ſuppoſe I ſhould have a thought in my heart, that
<hi>there is no Chriſt, but he whom the Goſpel ſpeaks of were
an impoſtor;</hi> I know not how this thought came there,
I have a ſuggeſtion to beleeve it, but my heart riſes
againſt it, cries <hi>avoid Sathan,</hi> I pray againſt it, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my ſelf, that my baſe heart ſhould ever have ſuch
a gueſt; for my part, I make a great queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe thoughts be a ſouls ſins, any more then
if a ſtrumpet ſhould come and lay a childe in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
porch or entry of an honeſt woman, it would
prove that the honeſt woman were the mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41393:65"/>
the baſtard lay in her entry or houſe, unleſſe
the law ſo adjudged it, in regard the door or entry
was open; So unleſſe you will ſay, that the heart
ſins by being no better ſhut, then to let ſuch a
thought be thruſt in, queſtionleſſe the very thought
as a formall ſinfull thought or motion, is not the
ſouls, but Sathans: But however, if it be thy ſin for
which thou haſt cauſe to be humbled; <hi>Yet it is far
from this ſin, this muſt be a conſtant owner and poſſeſſor
of thy heart,</hi> and a ſin of a far higher nature, then ten
thouſand ſuch thoughts are.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thou ſayeſt, <hi>O but I have ſinned many
times againſt knowledge, againſt the light of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
Conſider therefore, <hi>That though this ſin be
a ſin aginſt knowledge, yet every ſin againſt knowledge,
is not this ſin:</hi> Without queſtion <hi>Iacob</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>His very ſon</hi> Eſau; and <hi>David</hi> in committing mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and adultery; and <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
All theſe were ſins againſt knowledge, and yet
none of them ſins againſt the Holy-ghoſt. It muſt
be a ſin againſt the knowledge:</p>
               <p>1. Of a divine Truth.</p>
               <p>2. Of ſome fundamentall truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>3. Diſtinctly made known to thee. This is plain
from the ſixth of the <hi>Heb. 4, 5, 6. and</hi> 10. 26. And

this ſin alſo, the ſin of our firſt parents, it is a ſin
againſt the enlightening grace of the ſpirit of God,
yea, though thou haſt denied ſome truth, not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
&amp;c. Indeed for all ſuch ſins as theſe are,
thou haſt very great cauſe to be humbled (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,)
and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it down and mourn bitterly, that theſe
wickedneſſes may be forgiven, and doing ſo thou
needſt not deſpair of the pardon of them. But <hi>alas,</hi>
(ſaith a poor Chriſtian) <hi>I have in a paſsion or ſickneſſe,
when I knew it was the hand of God, blaſphemed God, or
I have at ſuch a time for fear of threats of death, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Therefore conſider,</hi> That though the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of thy knowledge and the truth of God, be a great
piece of this ſin, yet it is not enough to conſtitute it, and
beſides, it muſt be another manner of deniall, then that
which thou complaineſt of.<note place="margin">It muſt be a deliberate and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deniall, not raſh, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>

this ſin, for there muſt be a blaſphemy: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
An oppoſition to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is true, that deniall is an ingredient
in this unpardonable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in: But it muſt be,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A wilfull deniall, free,</hi> not ariſing from fear. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſo denied his Maſter, and many of the Martyrs
denied, yea, and abjured the Faith; But either,
Firſt, <hi>Sathan by his temptations, Secondly, Or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their fleſh,</hi> occaſioned it, for they at the ſame
time loved Chriſt, and the truth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It must be a deniall, on purpoſe to diſcredit the
truth, out of a venome and malice of heart to it.</hi> I may
deny a fundamentall truth, in an argument and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
to ſee how another can prove it, yet I

Comfort thy ſelf therefore Chriſtian, thou haſt not

though through the violence of Sathans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

onely go out and <hi>weep bitterly,</hi> renew thy love, regain

of the Martyrs did, rending their recantations, or
abjurations, and ſuffring Martyrdom gloriouſly.
But yet will ſome poor Chriſtian ſay. <hi>Alas! yet I

thy envy of him, may be an emulation, not being

               <p>Secondly, <hi>It muſt be with a ſecret deſire to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

a wretch is mad to ſee Gods name exalted, and to ſee

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>And it muſt be an oppoſition to the truth,
that to the wretch is known, and he is convinced,</hi> that

               <p>Seventhly, <hi>It muſt be a totall falling away from the

               <p>Eighthly, <hi>It is not probable</hi> (ſaith Maſter <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)
That thou ſhouldſt be guilty of that ſin againſt the

               <p>Ninthly, <hi>If thy ſin that thou complaineſt of ſo to be
the unpardonable ſin as thou unwarrantably thinkeſt, be a
trouble and a grief of heart to thee, thou maſt be ſure,
that it is not that ſin that thou takeſt it for,</hi> Heb. 4. 6. <hi>It
is impoſsible</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that they, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, ſhould be renewed again by repentance.</hi> The
meaning of which place, is not that if they do repent
yet it is impoſſible that they ſhould be pardoned,
that were to put a lye upon the promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
But it is impoſſible, that ever they ſhould
repent to be renewed:<note place="margin">Auſ. T. 10. Ep. de Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Domini 11. p. 45.</note> This makes Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

to the hardneſſe of his heart, refuſeth repentance,
and treaſureth up wrath againſt the day of wrath.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41393:68"/>
Now though I do not think (with Saint <hi>Auſtine)</hi> that
this is the whole formality of that ſin; nor yet (with
<hi>Aquinas</hi> and the Papiſts) that it can be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a ſpecies of that ſin, yet I think with almoſt all

that ſin; God after the commiſſion of that ſin, by
any poor wretch giving him over to a blindneſſe of

repent: But like <hi>Eſau, If he ſeeks repentance care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               <p>NOw for ſatisfaction to ſuch Chriſtians, let
us ſearch out the cauſe of ſuch complaints;
I conceive there may be a double cauſe.</p>
               <p>1. A miſtake in the nature and acts of Faith.</p>
               <p>2. A misjudging of the effects of Faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The complaints of ſuch a ſoul, which yet
all this time truely beleeves, may ariſe from a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
concerning the nature and acts of Faith; and
therefore the way to ſatisfie it will be rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it concerning them, and to this end, I ſhall but
propound to ſuch a ſoul to conſider theſe two things.</p>
               <p>1. That there are many acts and more degrees then
one, of true ſaving Faith.</p>
               <p>2. That true Faith is of ſo good a nature, that it will
and may dwell with many doubtings, and weakneſſes, in a
poor ſoul.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things cleared, I truſt many ſouls will
be ſatisfied; for commonly the miſtake is grounded
upon ignorance, conceiving there is no Faith, but
Faith of aſſurance, and that Faith comes to be no
Faith, if but a dram of doubting be mingled with
it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore I ſay, <hi>Firſt, That true Faith
hath ſeverall acts, and ſeverall degrees.</hi> A fulneſſe of
perſwaſion is not the leaſt act, or degree of Faith,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41393:71"/>
no not of true juſtifying Faith. There are notes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Ela. There is great quarrelling concerning
the nature and eſſence of true juſtifying Faith; ſome
will have it to be a bare knowledge. Thus (ſaith the
Apoſtle) <hi>The devils beleeve, and tremble:</hi> Some
will afford us a little more, and tell us that Faith
conſiſts in an aſſent, but beyond this they will not
ſtride; ſome in too full oppoſition to theſe denying
any certainty of perſwaſion and aſſurance to be, have
deſcribed Faith by an aſſurance and full perſwaſion,
which is the higheſt, and not the direct, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex
act of Faith, when indeed the very eſſence of
juſtifying Faith lieth betwixt theſe, in an act of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to, and reliance upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To Faith we grant a knowledge is required of
Gods word. But this we ſay is rather ſuppoſed to
Faith, then an act of true juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The loweſt act of Faith is <hi>an aſſent,</hi> a yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in thy ſoul to the word of God, an agreement
to the truth of it, <hi>Exod. 14. 31. Iſrael beleeved the
Lord, and his ſervant</hi> Moſes, <hi>[viz.]</hi> gave credence and
aſſent, agreed that it was juſt, and good, and true,
that the Lord ſpake, and relied upon the authority
of him that ſpake it; So by this act of Faith, doth
the beleever, when he hears the word of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
concerning his ſalvation, he cloſeth with it; as
ſuppoſe that, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. God ſo loved the world that he
gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeves in
him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Or that
of the Apoſtle, <hi>There is no other name under heaven,</hi>
whereby a man may be ſaved, <hi>but the name of Ieſus;</hi>
or that again, <hi>This a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41393:72"/>
ſinners.</hi> Faith now doth not onely know this, but
cloſeth with God in theſe truths: And ſo concerning
the promiſes of ſalvation, when God ſayes, <hi>Though
your ſins were as ſcarlet, I will make them as ſnow, though
they were as crimſon, yet they ſhall be white as wooll.</hi>
Faiths work now is to perſwade the ſoul to an aſſent
to, and credence of the truth of this good word of
God, yea, and it is not every aſſent that is an act of
Faith neither.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be a <hi>ſtedfaſt aſſent,</hi> The beleever doth
as verily beleeve the promiſe of God, as that he doth
live; he ſayes in his heart, and with his whole heart:
Firſt, <hi>The word that tells me this is the world of an ever-living
and unchangeable God,</hi> and it is undoubtedly his
Word. Secondly, <hi>It is the word of a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
God;</hi> The Apoſtle calls Gods Word, <hi>The word
of truth;</hi> And it is the word of truth either <hi>material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
the matter of it is truth, or <hi>objectively,</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it is truth. It hath the God of truth for the
Author, It is whole truth for the matter. And this
the beleever gives full and ſtedfaſt credit unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Yea, and he gives credit to every truth
that the word of God holds out to him as truth.</hi> Faith
quickens the ſoul, to thirſt after full diſcoveries of
truth, and quickens the ſoul, to receive every beam
of the light of truth, that ſhines into it. The <hi>Hebrews</hi>
ſay, <hi>That there is not the leaſt tittle of the law, upon
which great mountains do not depend.</hi> The beleever
ſaith, there's not the leaſt jot in the word of God,
upon which great mountains of truth do not depend,
not any leaf but the God of truth is wrapt up in. I
remember that it was Gods command in the 28. cha.
of <hi>Deut.</hi> That when the ſeverall curſes were read, all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41393:72"/>
the people ſhould ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> and that not to
this or that curſe, but at the denuntiation of every
curſe all the people ſaid <hi>Amen;</hi> I do not reade the
like command when the bleſſings were pronounced,
yet (without queſtion) their aſſent was required to
them as well as the other. But our hearts are ready
enough to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to bleſſings, and promiſes, but
we would not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to threatnings and curſes:
Now the beleever gives aſſent and credence to the
word of God,<note place="margin">V. Balls Treat. of Faith. 1. <hi>p.</hi>

               <p>Yea, and he gives thirdly, a <hi>clear aſſent to the word

ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to any thing, he will give his aſſent to
every piece of the word of God, and yet not a blinde
aſſent to any piece of it; but every truth that he
aſſents unto, ſhines into his ſoul with a light as
clear as the ſuns at high-noon-day. As Chriſt told
the woman of <hi>Samaria, Ioh. 4. 22. You worſhip you
know not what, but we know what we worſhip.</hi> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
had been very high about very great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
Chriſt had told her of a ſtrange gift he would
give her, <hi>Living water, v.</hi> 10. That ſhould have a
ſtrange quality, even a quality to quench <hi>thirſt for
ever, v.</hi> 14. She gave ſome aſſent to this, the water
pleaſed her taſt, but it was but a blinde aſſent, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſhe dreamed of ſuch a water as might ſatisfie her
bodily thirſt, that ſhe might no more come thither
to draw. And <hi>v.</hi> 20. When ſhe made a confeſſion
of her Faith to Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was juſt of the

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41393:73"/>
nor ſhorter (a Faith of the ſame laſt with moſt
now a dayes.) Chriſt told her that in the dayes to
come, there ſhould be a ſtrange kinde of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Father, <hi>Neither at Ieruſalem, nor yet in that
mountain. Ye worſhip ſaith he you know not what, but we
know what we worſhip.</hi> Many aſſent this day to the
word of God, They aſſent to it that there is a Chriſt
come into the world to ſave ſinners, &amp;c. None will
deny this, but it is in their brains but as a dark no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or elſe they have received it as a tradition of
their fathers. (Our forefathers religion is a great

they gave a kinde of a blinde credence, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to ſome things that were truths in the word; But
alas! they worſhipped they knew not what, they
had no clear diſtinct knowledge of thoſe truths that
they made an orall profeſſion of, and with their
mouths did pretend aſſent to. So wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
men now a dayes give a kinde of an aſſent to the
word of God, and to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt,
but it is far from the meaneſt, and loweſt act of true
Faith. When they hear or have received it from
tradition, that Chriſt was born of a Virgin, or
that Chriſt though eternall God yet was alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
man, that he died for ſinners, &amp;c. The wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
will tell you they beleeve theſe things; But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
they aſſent not to them as clear diſtinct truths,

they ſay they profeſſe they worſhip they know not

                  <hi>The natural

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41393:73"/>
will ſet his hand to them, but he doth but ſet
his hand to a blank if he does; Nor can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for the carnall man hath nothing but the buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of carnall reaſon to draw with, out of the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domable
depth of the myſteries of ſalvation; and
while he hath nothing elſe, thus reaſon diſputes,
and cannot but diſpute in his ſoul; If Chriſt be God,
How could he be born or dye? reaſon cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
theſe queſtions, therefore they ſeem dark to the
poor blinde wretch, and though he profeſſes he
gives credence to the word of God, in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
Yet his aſſent is but a dark and forced act of
his will, not a voluntary and clear act of it, cloſing
with the truth, and embracing of it; nor can it be,
becauſe (as I have ſhewed) his aſſent of his will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proceed from a well enlightned underſtanding,
without the precedency of which the will is but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
into an aſſent. The underſtanding is that
which holds the candle to the will in the ſoul: Now
the aſſent and credence which every true beleever
gives to the word of truth, though it be an act of
the will (for it is the wills act to delight in, and cloſe
with and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eal) yet it proceeds from a ſpiritually, and
clearly enlightened underſtanding, for it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings

in the wicked man, is but an act of his will
without any clearneſſe in the underſtanding, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
onely preſenting the truth, as a notion,
or tradition, or commonly received opinion, this
is far from an act of Faith, but ſuch as the devils
have. It is like the <hi>Athenian</hi> devotion, <hi>Paul</hi> coming
to <hi>Athens, Act.</hi> 17. 23. found an Altar with this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription,

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41393:74"/>
worſhipping argued ſome aſſent of the will, and the
will alwayes following the dictate of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
It is certain that there was ſome knowledge;
the truth was this, Their underſtanding had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up ſome generall notions of the Deity <hi>[That
there was a God, &amp;c.]</hi> and theſe might be ſeen by the
light of nature, or heard from their forefathers, and
ſuckt in by tradition. And it is plain it was no
more, for they ingenuouſly confeſſe, that the God
whom they worſhipped, was unknown to them;
they knew that there was a God, and poſſibly, that
this God was a ſpirit, and that this God muſt be
worſhipped, Naturall eyes diſcern all this, but it
was not a clear and diſtinct knowledge, and aſſent,
they worſhipped they knew not what, their Altar
was to the unknown God, As many name-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
beleevers at large, now a dayes mutter over
their common-prayers to their unknown God, and
come to Church to worſhip an unknown God, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  </gap>riſt came into the

Church-men and ſerve God, &amp;c. But now where
this is an aſſent in the ſoul (to a truth) as an act of
true Faith, it is out of a diſtinct and clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
It conceives a great deal of reaſon, why
it ſhould beleeve ſuch a truth, cloſe with ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
aſſent to ſuch a word, and the ſoul ſo clearly
and brightly ſees the truths, that it ſets its hand
and heart unto, that it wonders at the blindeneſſe of
carnall men, that they ſhould not ſee it as clear as
they do, but yet be blinde to the things of God;
when for their parts they are as clear to their ſouls
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41393:74"/>
as the ſun when it ſhineth at bright noon-day. And
therefore Faith is called, <hi>Heb. 11. 1. The evidence of
things not ſeen.</hi> The word tranſlated, evidence, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies, a convincing demonſtration, it
commeth of the Greek verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Leigh, critica.</note> which ſignifies
(ſay criticks) ſo to convince, and bring evidence
and reaſon for a thing, and prove it by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo clearly, that no man can either deny it or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
againſt it, or ſo much as pretend an objection
againſt it. Such is Faith to the gracious ſoul, it
perſwadeth the ſoul ſo to aſſent, that the ſoul is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced of the thing to be aſſented to; Faith
hath ſo fully perſwaded the ſoul of the word, truth,
promiſe, that it deſires its hand and heart, to that
the ſoul is fully ſatisfied in it, and is clear in it.
Though the beleeving ſoul neither doth ſee, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
to ſee the brightneſſe of ſublime myſteries, by
the eye of carnall reaſon; yet it ſees by another eye,
and ſo clearly every thing that it aſſents to, that it
conceives there can be no darkneſſe in it, no reaſon
nor objection pretended againſt it, but frivolous
and vain, and of no value. This is Faiths firſt act,
ſtedfaſt clear aſſent. Now in this the ſoul may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deceive it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Act of Faith (which we ordinarily
ſay is the very marrow, and eſſence of juſtifying
Faith) is <hi>reliance, and dependency upon</hi> Jeſus Chriſt,
when the ſoul having been perſwaded of the word
of truth, and aſſented to it; doth in the next place
hang, and depend upon it, as the word upon which
it muſt live, and commits his ſoul to Chriſt, and
hangs upon him as the Chriſt, by which he onely
can be ſaved; This I ſay is that Act which juſtifieth.

               <p>A ſixth word by which it is expreſt, is rolling and

So that we may ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the very eſſentiall act in
which conſiſts the marrow of juſtifying Faith, is
this</hi>—When the ſoul being perſwaded of the truth of
Gods eternall word, gives a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to it; to every curſe and threatning, as well as to
every promiſe, and yet doth not faint, nor ſink in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
nor drown in ſorrow; but in this apprehenſion of
its loſt and undone condition, runs to Ieſus Chriſt, as a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41393:75"/>
ſafe caſtle, and hangs upon him, committing the whole
burthen of its ſoul unto him, and ſtayes there, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and the promiſes of life, made in him to the ſoul.
<hi>This is now juſtifying Faith, which afterwards cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
in the ſoul a quiet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſting in God, a ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in God, a ſtedfaſt hope in him, and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
waiting for him; and at laſt a confident aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of him: But this is certainly Faith, ſo far as is
upon pain of damnation, neceſſary to ſalvation:
The going out of the ſoul unto Chriſt, and the whole
application of it ſelf to the promiſes of ſalvation
made in and by him; and whoſoever doth this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
and with a faithfull heart, is</hi> paſſed from death
to life, and ſhall never periſh, neither in this life nor
in the life to come; it puts its truſt in him that never
fails them that do ſo.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a third Act of Faith, <hi>Which is an
act of aſſurance and full perſwaſion,</hi> commonly called
by Divines, <hi>The reflex act of Faith.</hi> Now this Act
of Faith, <hi>Is when the ſoul is fully and throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that Ieſus Chriſt hath actually pardoned all its
ſins, and that it is his, and he is hers.</hi> This is not that
Act of Faith, concerning which the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
<hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with
God.</hi> It is rather a conſequent of juſtifying Faith,
that peace which floweth to the ſoul, as a fruit, and
a ſweet effect of juſtification; and that this is not
that Act of Faith which juſtifieth, is plain, <hi>Becauſe
the ſoul muſt be juſtified before it can put forth it ſelf in
this Act.</hi> This is a comfortable but not a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Act of Faith, and is more properly called <hi>[fides
juſtificati,</hi> then <hi>fides juſtificans]</hi> the Faith of a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
perſon, then juſtifying Faith: It is good and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41393:76"/>
ſpeciall juſtifying Faith, for the ſoul <hi>heartily and
ſincerely to deſire, and thirſt and hunger after the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgiveneſſe of its ſins, through the free grace
of Ieſus Chriſt, and confidently to reſt upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of free remiſsion and pardon.</hi> But it is another
pitch of Faith, and of an higher nature <hi>to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
aſſured, that all my ſins are really and fully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</hi>
It is one thing to beleeve, that my ſins, how
many and how great ſoever, ſhall be taken away,
and that God will ſmile upon me, and we ſhall not
finally periſh; And another thing to be fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that now God is well pleaſed with us, and all
our ſins are blotted out; Yea it is one thing to be
perſwaded, that our names are in the white book
of election, and our ſins decretally pardoned,
which was from eternity, and meritoriouſly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
which was, if ever, in Chriſts death, And
another thing to beleeve that God hath acquitted
us actually from the obligation to death, that is in
them; God ſo pardons in time, and in the Act of
juſtification. It is truth, we ought to ſtrive after a
Faith of aſſurance, but we are not neceſſarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to an aſſurance upon our juſtification; Faith
precedes actuall, and formall juſtification in our
conſciences, it is the inſtrument to apprehend it.
Now the Goſpel doth not, when it calls to me to
beleeve, oblige me to a lye: If before I am juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
I ſhould be tied to beleeve I am actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
the Goſpel would oblige me to that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to my juſtification, which I cannot upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
grounds beleeve, till after my juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
So that we cannot conclude, that we have not
true juſtifying Faith, that we do not beleeve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41393:76"/>
we cannot be confident God hath actually
and formally, in the court of our conſciences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
us from the guilt of our ſins; for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of juſtifying Faith, doth not conſiſt in that:
And yet we may not altogether ſhut out confidence,
and perſwaſion, out of the juſtifying Act of Faith,
give me therefore leave to adde a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>They be no part of faith;</hi> in that a man
doth beleeve, he doth not doubt; Faith and
Doubting may dwell under the ſame roofe, but
they marry not, nor mingle any bloods together,
they are not at all of a family. Faith is of the family
of Heaven, Doubtings are of the family of Hell;
they are inmates, but have little acquaintance one
with another, none at all with one anothers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
they are two things, though in one ſoule.</p>

                  <hi>for it is impoſsible that Faith ſhould

in what he beleeveth, doth not doubt; I cannot at

               <p>Firſt, becauſe Faith and Doubtings are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories,

<hi>Ela,</hi> at the higheſt pitch and note of faith, if they
had been above all doubtings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe Chriſt prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> that
when Satan winnowed him, his faith might not fail;
it could not faile, if every true faith were above all
doubtings.</p>

               <p>Complaint. <hi>Alas! I beleeve?</hi> I have not yet ſtept the

ſuch an ignorant wretch as I be a beleever? Beſides for
what I know I am ready to deny it; ſometimes I think
this is the word and truth of God; ſometimes again I
think it is not; I fully beleeve nothing, I know nothing,
I cannot read, nor underſtand when I heare; many
things in Scripture I know not; and for what I know
I know nothing as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now to ſpeak a word or two by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

               <p>For thy knowing nothing as thou oughteſt to
know (as thou complaineſt) it is happy for thy
ſoule, (if thou ſpeakeſt from thy heart,)
that God hath wrought thy heart into ſo
low an opinion of thy ſelf. See what the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 2. And if any man think that hee
knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought
to know it.</hi> But now for thy reall ignorance that
thou ſo much complaineſt of, I ſhall propound a
few conſiderations, which wil ſhew thee how much
ignorance may conſiſt with true faith in the ſoule,
and then conclude all with a caution or two.</p>
               <p>For the firſt,</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider, <hi>Thou mayeſt be ignorant in many
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41393:80"/>
points of Religion which are fundamentall in ſome
ſenſe, and yet have faith, true faith;</hi> I think, when
we ſpeak of fundamentals, we ought to diſtinguiſh;
ſome fundamentalls are abſolutely neceſſary, our
ſalvation ſtands upon them as; to beleeve, <hi>That Ieſus
Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
man, a Ieſus, a full Savior, that he dyed for us that
we might live; that there is no ſalvation in any other
but in him, and that in him there is a fulneſſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c.</hi> Theſe now are thoſe pillars upon which
our ſalvation ſtands, and the knowledge of which is
alwayes ſuppoſed to true juſtifying faith; none can
be ignorant in theſe, and beleeve; <hi>For how ſhall they
beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard</hi> (which was
the Apoſtles queſtion?) but now there are other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which are ordinarily called <hi>fundamentalls,</hi>
becauſe they are ſuch as Chriſtians learn, even in
the beginning of their converſion, ſuch as are firſt
taught, and laid for a foundation to build other
truths upon; the doctrine of the impoſition of
hands, reſurrection of the dead, &amp;c. are reckoned
up by the Apoſtle for fundamentalls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.
Now for theſe it is very poſſible that a Chriſtian
may be ignorant of them, and yet have a true faith
in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; The Doctrine of the
Trinity of the perſons, <hi>viz. That in the Deity there
are three diſtinct manners of being, three diſtinct ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences,
diſtinguiſhed each from other by their ſeverall
properties;</hi> This is without queſtion a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point of the ſecond ſort, ſuch as is uſually
taught Chriſtians as a piece of the foundation of
Religion; yet I do verily beleeve that a Chriſtian
may beleeve, and be in the ſtate of grace, and yet not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41393:81"/>
be inſtructed fully, but be ignorant in this. Suppoſe
a Miniſter ſhould go preach to Heathens, and
preach what need men in naturall condition have
of Jeſus Chriſt, what a wofull condition they are
in without him, what a readineſſe there is in Chriſt
to ſave them: and upon this preſſe faith; doe
you think it is not poſſible, that ſome ſoule may
be ſtartled, and run out of it ſelf, and reſt truly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Chriſt, and yet not be for the preſent ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
as to give you an account of the Trinity
of perſons? And yet without queſtion it is a truth
and a fundamentall truth too, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. v. 2. <hi>Paul</hi>
came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and found certain men that were
Diſciples, v. 1. He asks them if they had <hi>received
the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> they ingenuouſly confeſt, that they
were ſo farre from receiving the gifts of the Holy
Ghoſt, that they <hi>had not ſo much as heard whether
there was an Holy Ghoſt or no:</hi> I know moſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors
conſtrue it of the gifts of the holy Ghoſt;
but for my part I cannot ſubſcribe to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but think the latter clauſe hath more then the
former, and that there is an emphaſis in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
and ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. v. 9. we find the Diſciples of
Chriſt ignorant in the point of Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the dead, and Chriſt chides his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for their ignorance in this point,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Diſciples were ignorant concerning the Father,</hi> Ioh. 14. 8. Lord ſhew us the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth us.</note> 
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. v. 5.
The very Apoſtles were ignorant in the point of
Chriſts Kingdome, and rule, and dreamt of Chriſts
reſtoring the temporall Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael, Act.</hi> 1.
v. 6. This is the caſe of many a poor Chriſtian; it
may be it cannot read, or it hath not lived where
there hath been any faithfull powerfull ſoule-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning
preaching; but when Gods time comes,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41393:81"/>
he brings the ſoule to heare, and it doth poſſibly
heare of its poor, naturall, undone condition, and
that there is none other name by which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may be ſaved, but onely the Name of Jeſus:
yet this now being the work of Gods Spirit, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
carries on its own work, and creates faith in the
ſoule, brings the ſoule to truſt and rely on Ieſus
Chriſt. There may be divers fundamentall points
that the ſoule all this while hath not heard a word
concerning; as how many yeare ſometimes doth a
Miniſter preach, and not directly meddle with the
Doctrine of the Trinity, &amp;c? How many weeks, and
not preach the Doctrine of the Reſurrection? But
here is now the condition of ſuch a Chriſtian, after
the Spirit of God hath enlightned him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him, &amp;c. the poor ſoule (that regarded not
inſtruction before) now begins perhaps to learn to
read, pray; now he heareth the Word more, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
concerning God more, &amp;c. and every day
diſcovers more truth then other, to which the ſoul
by nature was blinded; then begins Satans work; the
ſoule reflects upon it ſelf, and begins to ſay, now,
<hi>Wo is me! I have my work ſtill to begin! I have made
my ſelf beleeve I have been a beleever ſo long; and
alas! I have been a poor, blind, ignorant wretch, blind
to the truths of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c. how could I beleeve
while I knew ſo little?</hi> Yes Chriſtian, thou mayeſt
be a Scholler, though thou beeſt but in thy <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
there are ſome truths which are the <hi>Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
ad ſalutem,</hi> the very foundation upon which
ſalvation ſtandeth; Now true faith is not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
without theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot reſt upon Chriſt, and
Chriſt onely for ſalvation, and yet not know that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41393:82"/>
there is a Chriſt, nor what this Chriſt is, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
a Saviour for me; without queſtion,
the knowledge of the Doctrine of faith in Ieſus
Chriſt the Son of God, and the Saviour of man,
what he is, what he hath done, what need we have
of him; what a fulneſſe there is in him; what a
ſufficiencie of ſalvation for every ſoule that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
&amp;c. is ſo much knowledge as is abſolutely
neceſſary, and without which no ſoule can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
yet this muſt not be underſtood without ſome
caution, as I ſhall ſhew you anon; for though it be
truth, ſuch a blind ſoule may be enlightned ſo far,
as truely to beleeve; yet if ſo, it will deny no truth,
but labour and thirſt after the knowledge of every
truth: A man may be a Grecian, and yet not know
every word in the Greek tongue, no not every
Radix: Beleevers ſhall not bee ſaved by their
Book.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A Beleever may be ignorant in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanciall
points of Religion, and yet be a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever;</hi>
this is clear from many examples in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>Peter</hi> himſelf did not know he might eat thoſe
birds and beaſts,<note place="margin">Acts 11.</note> which to the Iewes were unclean.
The beleeving Romanes did not know their liberty
in point of holy-dayes,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> and eating of meats firſt
offered to Idolls,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> which maketh the Apoſtle take
a great deale of paines for ſetting Rules to ſtrong
Chriſtians how to carry themſelves in relation to
their weak brethren,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> whoſe conſciences were ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at their eating; both in the 24. Chap. of his
Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and alſo in his Epiſtle to
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he harps upon the ſame ſtring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
The Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe</hi> were
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41393:82"/>
ignorant about the point of Chriſtian liberty. The
indulgent Maſter will not throw away the childs
Exerciſe for want of a Comma: Chriſt rejects not
the Chriſtians Faith becauſe it is not fringed with
a knowledge in every circumſtantiall in Religion:
I call no truth circumſtantiall (as by a ſlighting
and neglective terme) for it is a beame of God;
but as comparatively, though they be truths to be
known, embraced, loved, practiſed, yet they touch
not the vitals of ſalvation, as I may ſay: They are
not neceſſary to be known <hi>[ad eſſe]</hi> to make a true
beleever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>a Chriſtian may be ignorant in the Hiſtory
of the Bible, and yet have true juſtifying faith.</hi> Every
Scholler is not a Chronologer, nor an Hiſtorian,
no more is every beleever; I may know what
Chriſt was, though I know not what <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
were; I may know which way Chriſt took, to
bring my ſoule out of darkneſſe into marvellous
light, though I do not know which way <hi>Moſes</hi> took
to bring the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> I may
know there is but one King of Kings, though I do
not know how many Kings there were of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
<hi>Iudah.</hi> The Diſciples did not know all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
had ſpoken, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 25.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>a Chriſtian may be a true beleever, and
yet not know the meaning of many places in Scripture.</hi>
God would never have appointed expounders of
the Law, if every Chriſtian, <hi>qua</hi> Chriſtian, were to
have been a generall Commentator. That Well is
deep, and every one hath not a Bucket to draw.
There are that tell us, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Spirit reveales the
meaning of Scripture to the beleever, and would
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41393:83"/>
thence evince, that whoſo hath the Spirit, muſt
needs bee fit to unty every knot, and unriddle eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
myſtery of Scripture; but every one that hath
the Spirit, hath not <hi>the Spirit of propheſie:</hi> For thoſe
Scriptures which it is neceſſary in point of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every beleever ſhould know, every beleever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
the nature of them: God hath made the
water ſhallow, that the Lambs may wade; but for
thoſe places through which the beleevers paſſages
do not lie to Heaven, in which the Elephants may
ſwim, God doth not require that every Lambe
ſhould ſound thoſe depths.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>A Chriſtian may be ſo farre ignorant in the
fundamentalls, as that he cannot make them out, and yet
be a true beleever;</hi> he may be ignorant in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
by which the generals are demonſtrated; as
for example, he may know that Chriſt dyed for
him, and reſt upon the merits of his death for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, and ſo truly beleeve, and yet not be able to
make this out, by reaſon of his ignorance, how
Chriſt being God, ſhould be capable of death;
how the humane and divine Nature were conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
hee may know that Chriſt ſatisfied by his
active obedience for his actuall ſinne, and yet not
perfectly underſtand how Chriſt being man ſhould
be free from ſinne, being conceived by the Holy
Ghoſt. The boyes Exerciſe may be true Latin,
though he cannot pierce every word. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were beleevers, yet were ignorant concerning
the Reſurrection, yea, concerning Chriſts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Father,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 4, 5, 6. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
may bee cleare to them in the generall,
though through their infirmity and ignorance they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41393:83"/>
be not able to cleare it up in the ſeverall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>They may bee ſo farre ignorant in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialls
of Religion, as that they cannot diſpute
them:</hi> The faculty of beleeving, and the art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
are two things: I may know and beleeve
that which I cannot maintaine upon diſpute: It
is a knowne ſpeech of that female Martyr, <hi>I
cannot diſpute, but I can dye for Chriſt;</hi> if ſhe had
not beleeved, ſhe would not have dyed; ſhe could
maintain her faith with her blood, which ſhee
could not maintaine with her tongue: As every
Scholler, ſo every beleever is not a diſputant: It is
good Logick in Divinity, for the Chriſtian to
hold the concluſion, though he knowes not what
to ſay to the Sophiſters premiſes: But leſt now
ſome ſhould thinke and ſay, that I have laid Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a little too wide open; I muſt limit what I
have ſaid with two Cautions. To ſatisfie the
poore doubting Chriſtian in point of ignorance,
I have laid downe the truth in theſe Concluſions,
and ſhewed you how farre it is poſſible that a
man may bee ignorant, and yet a true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
But,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It muſt bee provided hee bee not content
with this ignorance,</hi> but uſeth the meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
knowledge, ſearcheth the Scripture,
and heares the Word; that this ignorance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
meerly out of infirmity, not of wilfulneſſe;
otherwiſe this knowledge will not bee ſufficient.
It is given as the character of unbeleevers,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 5.</note> 2 <hi>Pet. 3.
That they were willingly ignorant;</hi> Wee have an
High-Prieſt <hi>who can have compaſsion on the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41393:84"/>
and on them that are out of the way, for as
much as hee alſo was compaſſed about with infirmity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 2.</note>
But for the wilfully ignorant, the High-Prieſt
was to offer no Sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Know therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
that thou canſt have no comfort that thou
beleeveſt though thou beeſt ignorant, unleſſe (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing

have done what I can to diſpell theſe miſts of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,

Chriſt Jeſus will take the blind man by the hand,<note place="margin">Mar. 8. 23, 24, 25.</note>
if he beſeecheth him to touch him, provided hee
be willing to receive his ſight; And as hee did
not caſt off the blinde man that at firſt ſaw men
walking like Trees: So hee will not caſt off the
Chriſtian that at his firſt illumination ſees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truths like Trees, not clearely, diſtinctly, and
fully; but as he dealt with that blinde man, hee
left him not there, but hee put his hands againe
upon him, and made him ſee every man clearly:
So if thou belongeſt to Chriſt, hee will put his
hands againe upon thee, and make thee ſee every
portion of his divine truth more clearely; hee

doubts a Chriſtian that truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves,
may have conſiſtent with his
Aſſent, which I laid down as the
firſt act of faith; for knowledge is
rather ſuppoſed to faith, then an
act of it. You may remember I told you Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is an act of faith whereby the Beleever doth
firmly, fully, and clearly agree to the truth of God
revealed in his Word. Now (ſayes the doubting
Chriſtian) <hi>Alas! I have no faith, I ſcarce aſſent to
the Word of God at all; or if I do, many truths there
are that I cannot aſſent unto; and thoſe which I doe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41393:85"/>
aſſent to, ſometimes me thinks I do aſſent to them, and
ſometimes again no; and when I am at the best, my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is ſo miſty and dark, that I almost aſſent to I know
not what:</hi> Now I ſhall ſhew thee how much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and doubting, in relation to this act of faith,
may yet be conſiſtent with true juſtifying ſaith in
thee; I ſhall ſhew it for thy direction and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>A Chriſtian that is a true beleever,
may think that he doth not aſſent unto the Word of God,
when indeed he doth.</hi> It is a known maxime in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
That faith may be true without ſenſe of
faith; True Faith is one thing, and ſenſe of faith
is another; and as it is with the other acts of faith,
ſo it is with this alſo: As a man may cheat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that he doth aſſent, and conſequently truely
beleeve, though all the world may ſee that he
doth nothing leſſe by his irregular walking contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his profeſſed aſſent: So it is as true, that a
Chriſtian may truly aſſent unto the truth of God,
though he conceits he doth not aſſent; wee are
ordinarily ill Judges of the acts of our mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſecret and occult acts which traffique
between the ſoule and Heaven in an inviſible way;
and therefore the truth or falſhood of theſe acts is
ordinarily diſcerned by the outward acts of our
body, as if I hear a man profeſſing that his ſoule
doth aſſent and cloſe with that portion of Gods
Word, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9. Neither fornicators, nor idolators,
nor adulterers, nor effeminate perſons, nor abuſers of
themſelves with mankind, nor theeves, nor covetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners ſhall
inherit the kingdom of God;</hi> &amp; yet at the ſame time ſee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41393:86"/>
he lives in them very ſinnes; he ſhall pardon me,
if I do think that he doth not aſſent; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his tongue ſpeaks, yet his heart doth not cloſe
with it as a truth of Jeſus Chriſt: So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if I heare a true Chriſtian complaining that
he cannot get his heart to cloſe with the Word of
God, and what ever the world thinks, hee doth not
aſſent to the truth, yet if I ſee this man fearing to
ſin againſt God, and trembling at the threatning
Word of God, and walking as even as he can ſet
his feet, according to the directive part of Gods
Word, that as <hi>David,</hi> he makes the Word of God a
light unto his feet, and a lanthorn unto his paths;
Let them think what they will, they ſhall give
me leave to think that they doe aſſent unto, and
cloſe with the Word of God. Take a proof of it,
<hi>Ionas</hi> 3. v. 5. <hi>Ionas</hi> there had preached againſt <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,
Ion.</hi> 3. v. 4. yet 40 dayes, and <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall
be deſtroyed; v. 5. So the people of <hi>Nineveh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
God; that is, gave a full aſſent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>redence
to the Word of God, were perſwaded that that
which <hi>Ionah</hi> ſpake to them in the Name of the
Lord, was true: But how ſhall we know that? the
Holy Ghoſt tells us, it was evident by the effects,
they proclaimed a faſt, and put on ſack-cloth, from
the greateſt of them to the leaſt; it was manifeſt
by their actions, in relation to this Sermon, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and labouring what they could to pacifie the
wrath of God before the 40. dayes were come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
that they did verily think it was a word of
truth that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſpake to them, and that they were
perſwaded, and from this aſſertion of the Holy
Ghoſt we may certainly conclude, that when we ſee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41393:86"/>
men living, and acting according to the Word of
God, and ſquaring their lives by the compaſſe of
it, they do beleeve [that is, aſſent unto it] as a
word of truth, whether they will confeſſe ſo much
or no: As when we ſee a man build houſes, purchaſe
lands, give great portions to his children, keep a
great houſe, we may conclude he is rich, though he
goes as if he were not worth a groat, and though he
will tell you he is not worth a groat. The heart is
the ſeat of aſſent, and the throne of faith; confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not eſſentiall, nor ſenſe materiall to it. Senſe
of faith is comfortable, but truth and ſincere reality
of faith is that which is neceſſary: Confeſſion of
faith with our lips, brings glory to God externally;
but it is the reality of faith in the heart, which brings
glory to God internally: It is he that doth aſſent,
that <hi>doth</hi> the will of God; not he alwayes that ſaith
he doth it, or thinks he doth it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 28. We
have a parable propounded by Chriſt to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
it was of a man that had two ſonnes, and hee
came to firſt and ſaid, <hi>Son, go work to day in my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard;
he anſwered, and ſaid he would not, but yet hee
repented and went:</hi> And he came <hi>to the ſecond, and
ſaid likewiſe; and he anſwered and ſaid, I go Sir, and
went not: whether of the twain (ſaith Chriſt) did the
will of his Father? They ſaid unto him, The first.</hi>
To apply it. God ſayes unto all men, Beleeve, and
cloſe with, and be perſwaded of my truth. One
ſayes, I do beleeve and aſſent; but his irregular life
is ſuch, that all the world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ees he gives his tongue
the lye. Another ſayes, Lord, I doe not aſſent to
and beleeve it; yet he dares not ſwerve a foot from
it; Which of theſe, do you think, does the will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41393:87"/>
of Chriſt? Surely the latter, though he will not
ſay nor think that he doth it, but ſuffers his tongue
to give his heart the lye; indeed, ſenſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of faith is that which we ought to ſtrive
after, to be perſwaded that we do cloſe with the
truth of Chriſt; but yet many a one doth that which
he doth not know he doth; the Chriſtian is his
own worſt Judge, and doth, and will do more a
great deale for God then he will ſpeak of. But I
haſten to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A true beleever may ſometimes doubt
whether the Word of God be the Word of God, or no (or
indeed may be tempted to do it, rather then do it)</hi> this
is that which troubles many a gracious Chriſtian;
Alas! they do not beleeve the Word of God, they
are troubled with many Atheiſticall and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
thoughts, that they cannot tell what to think;
whether the Word be the Word of God, or onely
(as Atheiſts dreame) a modell of Scripture drawn
by ſome to keep mens conſciences in awe, &amp;c. and
this makes them conclude, Tuſh! I cheat my
own ſoule, to think I have faith, when I queſtion
even the principles of Chriſtianity, &amp;c. and ſhake
the foundation with one ſhake; and yet at the very
ſame time they live, cloſe to the rule of it, and it
hath a ſtrict and ſevere command over their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Now this I ſay is rather a temptation to
doubt of the truth of Gods Word in their ſoules,
then a reall and poſitive doubt. The Devill is very
buſie in ſuch manner of temptations; yea, even
Chriſt himſelfe ſhall not be without them, <hi>Mat. 4.
6.</hi> he had ſet Chriſt upon the pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and bid him caſt himſelf down; for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41393:87"/>
he ſhall give his Angels charge, &amp;c. in which
words I conceive as the Devill tempted Chriſt in
an unwarrantable way to reſt upon the promiſe, ſo
he alſo tempted him to doubt of the truth of the
Scripture: As if he ſhould have ſaid, If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be true, and you beleeve it, try a little, throw
thy ſelf down, thou haſt a promiſe to catch thee,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11. Throw thy ſelf down, and thou ſhalt ſee
now how true the Scriptures are, &amp;c. So the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
deales with Chriſtians often, ſets upon them
to deny the Scriptures, and puts ſuch thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hearts, &amp;c. which are but temptations, and
argue not a nullity of their aſſent to the Scriptures,
but an aſſault made upon their faith by Satan. But
may a Chriſtian ſay, If I could know this, it were
ſomething; how ſhall I know whether ſuch
thoughts be the ſpawn of unbeleefe, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from an internall cauſe, my own infidels heart,
or whether they be, as you ſay, meerly the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Satan, and aſſaults upon my faith. I ſhall
labour to tell thee briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They are ordinarily but Diſputations, and
Queries, not determinations:</hi> Thou oftentimes haſt
Quaeries in thy ſoule, What ſhould I think are
the Scriptures, the Word of God or no? They
have ſtrange things in them, one would wonder
they ſhould be the Word of Truth; thou never
commeſt poſitively to determine in thy ſoule,
Tuſh, they are not the Word of God. God gives
Satan leave to play the Opponent ſometimes, to ſee
what a Reſpondent the Beleever can be; but hee
alwayes keeps the office of the Moderator to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
when they never go beyond a diſpute in thy
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41393:88"/>
heart, that thou doſt not determine in thy heart
the contrary, nor declare with thy lips, nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
with thy life the contrary; it is a ſign they are
but temptations, though they argue weakneſſe, and
thou oughteſt to bee troubled and humbled for
them; if they were children of thy owne begetting,
thou wouldſt nouriſh them better.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If they be onely temptations, thou findeſt
a ſtriving against them.</hi> Tell me Chriſtian, when
thou haſt ſuch an Atheiſticall thought laid at the
doore of thy heart, that the Scriptures are not the
truth of God, what doſt thou do with it? what
doſt thou take it, and ſuckle it, and rock it, and
nurſe it as thy owne childe? Doſt thou pleaſe thy
ſelf with ſuch thoughts, and labour to coine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to maintaine and hug them? This
is a note of a baſe heart: Or art thou impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of it, but preſently cryeſt out, Ah Lord! what a
baſe heart have I? And doſt thou labour to beat
ſuch thoughts out of thy heart, and pray againſt
them, and never liſten to any argument Satan
would bring to tempt thee to the beleefe of it? I
beleeve this is thy tempter, and know if it be, thou
mayeſt have ſuch thoughts and doubts, and yet be a
true beleever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If it be not reall unbeliefe, but a meere
temptation to unbeliefe, thy thoughts will not be long.
Iames 4. 7. Reſiſt the Devill, and he will flee from you.</hi>
The Devill, if he be left to ſtand upon his own legs,
is as very a coward as lives; he will come and tempt
a beleever, to deny the Scriptures to be the word of
truth; the beleever findes theſe filthy thoughts
caſt into his heart, he conſiders Arguments to reſiſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41393:88"/>
this temptation, cryes and prayes, and ſayes, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
Lord help my unbeleefe; Away goes Satan
preſently, will anſwer never an Argument, but yeeld
the field, and the beleevers heart is fixed preſently.
I mark this in 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> we read there of three
weapons the Devill took up at Chriſt, v. 3. Hee
tempteth him to diſtruſt Gods providence. Chriſt
reſiſts this, v. 4. The Devill hath done with this,
not a word more to ſay; well, he flyes to another,
v. 5. tempts him to preſume unwarrantably upon
Gods providence, and to deny the truth of the
Scriptures. Chriſt reſiſts this, v. 7. The Devill
durſt not reply, but leaves this too; well, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
himſelfe to another, v. 8. Chriſt reſiſts this,
v. 10. Satan hath not a word to ſay but the coward
quits the field, packs up and gets himſelfe away, v.
13. Try thy thoughts, are they dwelling thoughts,
or tranſient? if they abide not, they are Satans, that
carries bag and baggage with them when he leaves
thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thou mayſt know if they be temptations,
by thy life; thou art ſometime ready to think that the
Scriptures are not the word of truth, thou canſt not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to them; but at this very time durſt thou live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the rule of the Scripture?</hi> Dareſt thou now
go and be drunk and be unclean? for what now
ſhould keep thee in awe? Dareſt thou? then 'tis
unbeleefe. But at this very time, if thou durſt not
but live according to that Word of Truth which
yet thou art in doubt, whether it be the Word of
truth or no, ſay what thou wilt, thou doſt aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and Satan would but fool thee of thy faith:
Thus you have heard how a Chriſtian may doubt,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41393:89"/>
or rather be tempted to doubt ſometimes, whether
the Scriptures be the Word of Truth or no, and yet
have and give a true and firm aſſent unto it as the
Word of Truth; and you have heard me giving ſome
notes how a Chriſtian may know, whether ſuch
thoughts proceed from a principle of unbeleef and
diſſenting to the Word of Truth, or from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Satan; I come to the third Concluſion,
which is this;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>A Chriſtian may be a true beleever, and yet
not fully aſſent to ſome particular truth in the Word of
God:</hi> There are many pieces of Gods Truth in
Gods Word: The Word is the word of an eternal
wiſdom, and of a depth too deep for us (that have
but narrow capacities, and finite buckets) to finde
the bottom of it: Now I conceive it is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to a true beleefe and aſſent, that I ſhould aſſent
to every thing in the Word of God; nay, which of
us <hi>doe</hi> doe it? The cauſes of this may be theſe:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ignorance.</hi> I ſhewed you before when I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that point, that there may be a great deal of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
conſiſt with true faith; ignorance in point
of Doctrine, and ignorance in circumſtantialls,
ignorance in divers things which are not of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity to ſalvation: Now I conceive that
aſſent doth alwayes imply knowledge. How ſhall
they beleeve on him of whom they have not heard
(was the Apoſtles queſtion:) Now I conceive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to a particular truth, as the truth of God,
doth nor conſiſt in a bare negation, but hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
poſitive in it: I conceive, that I cannot bee
ſaid to Aſſent to all things from which I doe not
diſſent; but if I aſſent, I doe ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y agree and cloſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41393:89"/>
with ſomething as a truth, and it hath the atteſt of
my heart. Now in this regard a Chriſtian cannot
be properly and poſitively ſaid to aſſent unto any
truth of God which he doth not know, though it
be contained in the Word of Truth, to which hee
doth fully and firmly aſſent: As for example, it was
a truth that the beleeving Romanes were not after
Chriſt was come, tyed to dayes and meats, it was a
truth of Gods Word; yet it is cleare, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4 Rom. 4,
5,</hi> 6. &amp;c that they did not know, and were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this truth, and ſo conſequently did not,
could not aſſent unto this particular truth, though
in Gods Word; yet it is clear, that they were true
beleevers, and ſo conſequently did aſſent unto the
whole word of truth <hi>conjunctim,</hi> though not to
every particular portion and piece of truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that word <hi>diviſim;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> there is a further revelation
of truth for beleevers: <hi>If any</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveale this to him;</hi> but
till that revelation, there cannot be expected a full
aſſent; onely thus farre, The Chriſtian that is the
true beleever, doth not diſſent from any truth in the
Word of God, but prayes for the increaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that ſo his faith alſo may increaſe in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with the truth, and giving full aſſent unto
the Truth of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It may be occaſioned through weakneſſe:</hi> Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſomething may be taught from the Word of
God, which is the Truth of God, that I heare, and
cannot altogether and firmly aſſent unto, and cloſe
with for truth. As put caſe it be the baptizing of
infants, without queſtion it is the truth of God, and
a truth revealed in his Word, that infants ought to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41393:90"/>
be baptized, and it is a robbing of the child of its
right, not to bring it to that holy Sacrament; yet
through weakneſſe, ſome that yet do aſſent to the
Word of God, and would gladly cloſe with every
portion of truth revealed in it, dare not aſſent to
this particular portion of Truth, but are grieved for
their weakneſſe in it, and deſire to walk up to every
portion of truth they know in the word; ſhall wee
ſay their faith is not true in any clearely revealed
piece of truth, becauſe to this they cannot declare a
full aſſent, though even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this they do not diſſent,
ſo as to deny this to be a truth, but labour after a
more cleare manifeſtation of it? God forbid; hee
that conceales the Truth in unrighteouſneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
cannot bee ſaid to beleeve; but he that to
ſome particular portion of truth (not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvation) is a debtor through weakneſſe,
I conceive cannot come alwayes within the cenſure
of an infidell: 'Tis one thing peremptorily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any particular portion of truth; and another
thing not to ſubſcribe to it, and by a preſent aſſent
not to cloſe with it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>A Chriſtian that is a true beleever, may
poſſibly not aſſent to the true meaning of Scripture, yea
cloſe with a falſe meaning in this or that particular
place,</hi> Beleevers judgments are not all of a Laſt, and
many a one that doth fully and firmly aſſent to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tittle of Gods Word, doth not, cannot alwayes
ſubſcribe to the judgement of this or that man, or
to the ordinarily received opinion of godly men
concerning ſuch or ſuch a portion of Scripture.
Scripture is very deep, who can finde it out? and
though the Holy Ghoſt hath left ſome ſhallowes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41393:90"/>
that the meaneſt Chriſtian may wade through, yet
there are alſo ſome depths which are paſt finding
out; places, about which the learned in the world
have poſed themſelves: VVe ſee it an ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
even in the dayes wherein we live; ſuch or
ſuch an Expoſition hath been received almoſt of all
former Writers; yet when one of us cometh to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the grounds of ſuch or ſuch a ſenſe, and to
weigh the context, and compare it with other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture, though we aſſent to the truth (if
it be one) as wrapt up in ſome other portions of
Scripture, yet we cannot aſſent to it, as the truth
of that place; and yet poſſibly it may be too, that
theirs is the truth of it and ours is the errour: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
misbeleever is not an unbeleever; nay yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>A man may miſunderſtand ſome places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and thereupon hold that to be truth which is not;
(ſo it be not in the points that are neceſsary and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
to ſalvation) and yet have true faith, and yeeld
true aſſent unto the Word of God.</hi> Every particular
imperfection in a righteous mans life will not argue
that a man is an unrighteous man in the generall;
nor every deviation from truth, argue a man an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick;
nor every miſtake of truth, argue that a man
doth not aſſent unto the truth of Gods Word. The
Diſciples did verily beleeve that Chriſt ſhould have
a reall Kingdome upon the face of the earth, that
ſhould break in pieces all other Kingdomes, and
conſume them utterly,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 6.</note> as is cleare, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6. They
asked of him <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the kingdom
to Iſrael?</hi> And the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children was
ſpeaking for Courtiers places for her ſons, which
was but a plaine and cleare miſtake of that place in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41393:91"/>
the 2 of <hi>Daniel,</hi> 44. yet who durſt but ſay they had
true faith?<note place="margin">2 Dan. 44.</note> So, many in theſe dayes do clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that Chriſt ſhall reign perſonally here upon
earth, a thouſand years, with his Saints (it is the
Millenaries opinion) which for my part I do not
think it is true (and I think that is the opinion of
the moſt) and I think it is a cleare miſtake of that
place,<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 4. and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                  <hi>Revel. 20. v.</hi> 4. yet I would be loth to ſay,
that one cannot aſſent, and truly aſſent to the Word
of God, that runs upon this miſtake; ſurely ſuch
an opinion is conſiſtent with true faith; indeed if
a man doth not fully aſſent to thoſe truths revealed
in Scripture that hold the foundation of faith firm
and ſtedfaſt, then you may ſuſpect the truth of
his pretended faith. I come to the laſt Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A Chriſtian may truly beleeve, and truly,
and clearly aſſent unto the truth of God, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in all things give a cleare evidence for his aſſent.
<hi>This is that which puzleth many a Chriſtian:</hi> Alas!
I cannot clearly diſcern the truth of God in his Word,
I may think I aſſent, but can I be ſaid to aſsent to that
which I cannot clearly ſee, and comprehend, and make
out? <hi>Yes, without queſtion, there are but very few
truths of God which the Chriſtian hath a clear and
full ſight of, and gives a cleare aſſent unto; for a
clearneſſe of aſſent muſt proceed from a clearneſſe
of knowledge. Now a truth may be cleare to a

               </list>
               <p>There are ſome truths which are clear even to
the naturall man, to the eye of his reaſon, as that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41393:91"/>
there is a God; that we are all gone a ſtray from the
wayes of God, in which we were firſt ſee; to theſe
even the carnall man may give a cleare atteſt, for he
ſees a great deal of reaſon that demonſtrates theſe
and ſuch like truths unto him: But now there are
ſome truths, which to the eye of Reaſon are as dark
as midnight, as Chriſts aſſuming the humane nature,
and the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the ſublime
Doctrine of Chriſts union with the ſoule, &amp;c. Now
theſe alſo in ſome manner are cleare to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
mans eye of Faith, in regard that he doth beleeve
the Word of God, and that ſo plainly holds out
theſe divine truths, it is clear to him that they are
truths, he ſees a great deale of reaſon for him to
beleeve contrary to reaſon; but yet when he comes
to think how ſhould theſe things be? and ſo puzle
his faith with reaſon, he doth not clearly then ſee
that upon a particular enquiry, which in a generall
notion ſeemed very cleare unto him; as in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that truth concerning the eſſentiall and reall
union betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and the ſoule, the true
Beleever thinks he ſees it very clearly, and beleeves
it very ſtedfaſtly, while he onely conſiders the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of it, and looks upon it as it is a truth; but now
when he comes to conſider how ſhould this be?
there, that knowledge which ſeemed cleare before,
appeares very dark and miſty; and ſo concerning aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
which followes the knowledge of any truth.
I remember a paſſage of a Reverend Divine of our
owne, <q>There is a manifeſtation of things by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and by revelation; an evidence direct, and not
direct; and evidence direct, and by conſequence; an
evidence of the thing in it ſelfe, and by the effect;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41393:92"/>
matters of faith are manifeſt by revelation, but in
reaſon inſearchable and incomprehenſible.</q> The
Divinity of the Scripture is in it ſelf evident to the
ſpirituall man; ſo is it that there is a providence.
other things are evident from this ground. <hi>Ball
upon faith, p.</hi> 22. thou mayeſt not judge that thou
haſt no faith, or that thou doſt not aſſent to the
truth of God, becauſe every truth in the Scripture
is not in it ſelf evident unto thee, ſo as thou canſt
give a cleare and rationall aſſent unto it; it may be
a clear aſſent to the truth in generall, though not
in the particulars; there it may be dark, as in that
Doctrine of the Trinity: I may be perſwaded, and
clearely to my thinking ſee that there is a Trinity,
it may be a notion as cleare as the Sunne unto me,
becauſe I take the witneſſe of Gods Word as a
ſufficient evidence to me; but yet if I will go poſe
my Faith with Reaſon, I ſhall not be able from an
evidence of Reaſon to give direct aſſent unto that
truth: It may be cleare as any thing to my faith,
That Gods eſſentiall preſence is wholly every
where; yet when I come now to look to ſee this
with reaſon, how the incomprehenſible God ſhould
be wholly in this or that roome, when I come neer
I have a very dark ſight, and my aſſent is ſcarce clear
to this truth: Some Pictures, the further you ſtand
off them, the more you ſee of them; it is a clearer
ſight that you have of the picture at a diſtance then
cloſe by it: So it is with ſome divine truths, they
ſeem very cleare to the Chriſtian aloofe off, while
he onely views them with the eye of his faith, and
does not come neer them with the feet of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
but if once he drawes neer with thoſe earthy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41393:92"/>
feet to them, they ſeem very dark. And thus I have
ſhewed you what doubts a Chriſtian may meet
withall in relation to his aſſent; what weakneſſes
may be incident to it, and conſiſtent with it, though
arguing imperfection and weakneſſe.</p>
               <p>1. He may doubt whether he doth aſſent or
or no, and yet at that time truly aſſent and cloſe
with the Word of Truth.</p>
               <p>2. He may doubt whether the Scriptures be the
Word of God or no, or at leaſt may be tempted to
doubt; and there I have given ſome marks by which
a Chriſtian may diſtinguiſh a temptation to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a reall doubting proceeding from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe.</p>
               <p>3. Hee may doubt concerning ſome particular
truths in the Word of God, and through ignorance
or weakneſſe not fully aſſent to them, and yet fully
cloſe with the Word ſo farre as is revealed to
him.</p>
               <p>4. He may doubt concerning the meaning of
this or that portion of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſſent from
the (ordinarily received) truth of it, and yet truely
aſſent to the Word of God; yea, he may miſtake a
Scripture, and hold that as a truth from that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon his miſtake, which is indeed an errour,
and yet ſavingly aſſent to the Word of Truth, ſo it
be not in neceſſary fundamentals.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he may not clearely by an evidence of
Reaſon, or a direct and diſtinct evidence of Faith,
aſſent unto ſeverall truths which are in the Word of
God, and yet truly aſſent unto the Word.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee true Faith may conſiſt with much
weakneſſe and doubting; as with much imperfection
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41393:93"/>
and ignorance in reſpect of the required knowledge;
ſo with much imperfection and doubting in relation
to the act of aſſent: Make uſe of this, to ſee Gods
goodneſſe that wil take ſuch ſacrifices at our hands;
not to preſume to hug theſe imperfections, but be
alwayes ſtriving againſt them,<note place="margin">1. Caution, provided we alwayes ſtrive againſt them.</note> that thou doſt not
wilfully cheriſh any of them; there are many, and
may bee many deficiencies in the underſtanding
that God will paſſe over; but if they come to bee
the rebellions of the will, thou ſhalt know hee is
angry. It is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 4. 19. 20. that Abraham ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
not through unbeleefe; Abraham doubted through
infirmity though,</hi> when he lay with <hi>Hagar,</hi> and bid
<hi>Sara</hi> ſay ſhe was his ſiſter. Strive againſt theſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and let them be thine meerly through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(if they be) not of wilfulneſſe; meerly of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
not through unbeleef, and the Lord is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
and thy faith may be true. If thou doſt ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
aſſent to all the Truth of God, that is the
foundation of faith, and neceſſary to ſalvation,
and fully and impartially cloſe with the whole
Word of God, and every particular portion of
truth in it, when it is once cleare to thee that it is
a ſyllable of that Word of Truth, and liveſt a life
anſwerable to it, though for the preſent thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou doſt not aſſent, and though thou mayeſt be
tempted ſometimes to doubt of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and though thou mayeſt doubt concerning
ſome particular truths that are taken for truths, and
are ſo, and concerning this or that portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and mayeſt take up that as a truth which is an
errour from it, and though thou mayeſt not for the
preſent by a cleare evidence of reaſon, or a direct
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41393:93"/>
and diſtinct evidence of faith aſſent unto ſeverall
truths which are in the word, provided,</p>
               <p>1. That thou aſſentest to all truths that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
to be beleeved to ſalvation, and the foundations of
Faith.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Provided thou ſtriveſt againſt other doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and laboureſt to get a ſenſe of Faith, and a ſtrength
to reſiſt the Devils temptations, and to be convinced of
every particular truth,</hi> and of thy errour (if it bee
one) which thou haſt taken up from ſome miſtaken
portion of Scripture, and laboureſt for a more

from the effects of faith: The acts of the minde are
ſecret acts, of which (as I ſaid before) we are very
ill Judges; Reſting and relying upon Chriſt is an
act of the minde, and is an hidden and myſticall act
which we cannot weigh in any ſcales to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be full weight yea or no; here's the trouble
of many Chriſtians; ask them whether they reſt and
rely upon Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation yea or no, they
will tell you, they cannot think they do; yet they
will confeſſe, that if they do not rely upon him,
they rely upon nothing; their ſinnes and duties,
their morality and civility they have utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
and will cry out of theſe as menſtruous
clothes and filthy rags, yea and confeſſe that they
would not, they durſt not ſin againſt God for a

Chriſt for ſalvation, though they will confeſſe
they deſire it, and hope they do it, and they make
the Law of Chriſt the rule of their lives, and they
have a ſecret ſoule-enflaming love to Chriſt; but
becauſe they cannot underſtand the ſecret myſtery
of the internal act, therefore they will not, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flatter their ſouls into a faith and apprehenſion
that they do truly beleeve, when indeed there is no
act of the mind, the nature of which, and truth of
which, we can diſcover from the knowledge of it
clearly in it ſelfe, but muſt be forced to examine
the truth and falſhood of it by the effects; and it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41393:96"/>
muſt be the infinite and rare work of God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
our ſenſe of the truth of our faith; may it
not be poſſible, think you, to finde one that is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
very beautifull, and yet all her friends ſhall
not perſwade her that ſhe hath any beauty at all?
we may have that which we will be not known of:
The woman hath ſeen her face in a falſe glaſſe, or
doth not know what beauty is, and therefore will
not be perſwaded by other mens eyes to rectifie her
owne judgement: So it is with Beleevers, they may
have a beautifull face of faith, and yet not thinke
ſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A Chriſtian may have a true faith, and

all truſt and rely upon Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Senſe in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may not onely have a miſt caſt before its eyes,
but have its eyes clearly put out. Suppoſe a man
had put up a Petition to the King for ſome place
of honour and truſt, this Petition lyes unanſwered a
great while, at laſt the King anſwers this Petition,
and grants that place or dignity to him; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
being at a diſtance from the Prince may have
this place or honour conferred, and yet not know
of any ſuch matter, but verily beleeve his Petition
lies like a caſt paper, hath he not his dignity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knows it not? Chriſtians are misjudging
creatures, and too ready to ſuſpect their owne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
they may call their reſting and beleeving,
preſumption; their faith, boldneſſe: The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
calls his droſſe Gold, his Alchymie Silver,
and the ſelf-ſuſpecting Chriſtian is as ready on the
other hand, to call his Gold Braſſe, and his Silver
Lead: It is a rare thing to finde a Chriſtian that

will look his gracious face in a true Glaſſe, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
creature is afraid he ſhould be proud, if hee
ſhould look upon his beauty: Heaven may bee
hid under the dark and cloudy apprehenſions of a

Heaven, Thou art ſaved, Thou art ſaved, while thou
art ſaying upon earth, O I am damned, I am dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned!
The Angels may be keeping holy-day for
thee there, while thou art keeping Fridayes here:
There may be joy in heaven for the ſame cauſe, and
at the ſame time for which and in which there may
be ſorrow on earth; thou mayeſt have more friends
in Heaven then thou knoweſt of; Chriſt at that
very time may be pleading hard at Heavens Barre
for thee, while thou art thinking he is reading an

have Chriſt in thy armes, when thou thinkeſt he is

but I have mentioned it, becauſe I have found
this to be the temper of many Chriſtians: pinch
upon that piont, ask them whether they wholly reſt

doe; but they cannot tell what to think, they k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not whether they do or no; though they dare not
conclude the falſhood and nullity, yet they dare
not aſſert the reality and verity of any act of Faith in
their ſoules, they live at great incertainties, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41393:97"/>
this makes them think they do not beleeve. They
are ſure diſputing is no beleeving.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer in this concluſion;</p>
               <p>That thou mayeſt make a queſtion whether thou
beleeveſt or no, and yet truly beleeve. It is true, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
is no beleeving; but though they be not
things of the ſame nature, yet they are not ſo ill
neighbours but they may dwell under the ſame roof
of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Thou mayeſt doubt whether thou beleeveſt or
no, and yet beleeve;</hi> this is not a queſtion about the
object of faith in which thou mayeſt for all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
unſhaken, but meerly about thy act of faith;
thus diſputing, thou doſt not diſpute whether the
promiſe be true or no, but whether thou art (as
thou ſhouldeſt be) perſwaded of the truth of it,
and doſt (as thou oughtſt) reſt upon it for a word
of truth; and yet ſome diſputes and doubtings about
the object are not inconſiſtent with faith, as I have
ſhewed before. It is a ſoule-deſtroying opinion
which ſome <hi>Libertines</hi> have hatched in theſe dayes,
that a Chriſtian ought not to queſtion the truth of
his Faith: Such an unbeleefe ſhuts not men out of
Heaven, nor argues a nullity of Faith: <hi>Paul</hi> was
wrapt up into the third Heaven, whether in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
he could not tell, or whether out of the body he
could not tell, yet without queſtion <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt
up in the body, if wrapt up at all: The Beleever
may be in the like doubt concerning his Faith that
S. <hi>Paul</hi> was concerning his rapture, and yet have
reall true Faith; though we ought not to content
our ſelvs with it, yet we may know for our comfort,
that we may go diſputing our faith to Heaven, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41393:98"/>
many a one hath ſuch an hot diſpute with his own
ſoule, that his death is forced to prove the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
when he receives his end of his Faith, even
the ſalvation of his ſoule. And thus I have ſhewed
you in three particulars, how the Chriſtian may
doubt concerning his reſting and relying upon
Chriſt, and yet truly rely.</p>
               <p>1. He may queſtion whether he truly relies or
not.</p>
               <p>2. He may not be able to affirm nor think that
hee doth truly relie; yea further, he may through a
misjudging himſelfe think he doth not rely, and
notwithſtanding all this truly and really rely and
reſt. Now theſe kinds of miſgivings may ariſe from
ſeverall cauſes: God may pleaſe for his ends to
keep the ſoule in darkneſſe, to keep it humble, and
to keep it in a ſtrict way of adherence, &amp;c. But I
ſhall rather meddle with the ſubordinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
cauſes, and aſſigne three or foure
cauſes:</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>may be blindneſſe and ignorance,</hi> there may
be, yea is a great deale of darkneſſe in the ſoule;
there was a thick darkneſſe ſurprized <hi>Adams</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
when he fell, and this ſtill clouds all the
children of <hi>Adam;</hi> we are not able to diſcerne or
judge of the nature of the internall acts of the
minde; we cannot come to a certaine knowledge
of them as they are in themſelves, but as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
muſt judge them by the effects; the ſoule doth
not underſtand what affiance is, and this makes her
queſtion whether ſhe doth rely or no, and not think
ſhe doth, being never ready to think well of her
ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:41393:98"/>
                  <hi>A ſecond cauſe may be the Devils temptations;</hi> ſuch
winds will make ſtrong houſes ſhake ſometimes:
It is Satans great deſigne to keep the ſoule from
beleeving, and if he cannot keep the edifice of
Faith from being built in the ſoule, yet he will keep
it (if poſſible) from ſtanding ſure. <hi>Luke 22. 31.
Simon, Simon,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Satan hath deſired to
winnow thee like wheat;</hi> the word ſignifies to ſhake
up and downe as in a fan wheat is uſed, the kernells
ſcarce ever lie ſtill: Satan is almoſt alwayes ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Chriſtian by the ſhoulders, he deſires to
winnow them, and as with <hi>Iob,</hi> becauſe he had no
power over his life, he executed his power to the
utmoſt upon the comforts of his life: So he deals
with the ſoule, becauſe he hath no power over the
life of Faith, therefore he will execute his power
to the utmoſt over the ſoul, that it may never come
to have the comfortable ſenſe of Faith; and no
wonder if when he brings his rammes to batter, the
poor mud wall of a Chriſtian ſhakes, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how ſmooth an Orator he is to perſwade,
and how ſubtill a Sophiſter he is to prove: Even
as it is as eaſie with a good Logician to make a
poor ſimple creature beleeve, ſo as he cannot deny
that the Sun doth not ſhine; ſo it is an eaſie thing
with the Devill to perſwade the ſoule, that it doth
not reſt and rely, when indeed it doth; eſpecially if
we conſider,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>What a miſgiving nature and ſuſpicious
frame there is ordinarily in the hearts of Beleevers.</hi>
They are alwayes fearing and ſuſpecting, leſt they
ſhould not doe their duty, they know that in many
things all ſinne, and they are afraid leſt they ſhould
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41393:99"/>
cozen and deceive themſelves; now when Satan
takes a flint and a ſteele, and falls a ſtriking, and he
meets with ſuch a box of ready dry'd tinder, no
wonder if hee quickly ſtrikes fire; Beſides,</p>
               <p>A fourth cauſe may be melancholy, cloudy vapours,
that for the preſent the ſoule is darkned with, and can
ſee nothing with a cleare ſight, but is like a man in a
phrenzie.</p>
               <p>And a fifth cauſe may be, <hi>a Christians wilfulneſſe,
when the Christian will take no evidence of his faith
by the effects of it:</hi> The beſt evidence that we either
have, or can have of the truth of our faith, and of
our juſtification is the effects of Faith; now if it
comes to this, that the ſoule will not take any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the truth of the act of Faith, but onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Broad Seale of Heaven, the apprehenſion
and aſſurance, and full perſwaſion of it, the ſoule
may live without comfort a great while, if with
<hi>Thomas</hi> it muſt ſee the wounds and holes; Now
here's many a good ſoules condition; he queſtions
the truth of his Faith; we come to him and tell him,
could there be ſuch an hungring and thirſting
after the Word, that thy eare is unſatisfied with
hearing, unleſſe thou didſt beleeve this was the word
of God, and reſt upon it as the Word of truth?
Could there be ſuch a care to pleaſe Chriſt, and a
feare of offending him to be found in thy whole
life and converſation, if thou didſt not rely upon
him for ſalvation? Could there be ſuch a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to part with all thy eſtate for Chriſt, and rather
then thou wouldſt deny him or not enjoy him in his
Ordinances, if thou didſt not rely upon God as thy
portion? No, the ſoule will not look upon this as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41393:99"/>
a ſufficient evidence, but cryes out, All this an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
may doe, ſanctification is imperfect, mine
is hypocriſie; No, would God ſeale it to me, then
I would beleeve it. Now where this is found, the
ſoule may for a long time ſit in darkneſſe, and ſee no
light; yea, it may be, go down to the grave in its
owne thoughts, like <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hanging betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell. But I proceed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thou mayſt not at all times truſt with
alike confidence, and yet at all times truly truſt.</hi> The
truth of truſt and affiance is one thing, the degrees
of it another; the truth of Faith never grows more
or leſſe, the degrees of Faith do; as the leaſt drop
of water is water, ſo the leaſt dram of faith is faith
as much as the higheſt degree of it: This the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of every Chriſtian will tell you; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they will ſay, I think if the Devill had hold
of me I could truſt God for Heaven. <hi>Though hee
kills me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) yet I will trust in him;</hi> that was
not <hi>Iobs</hi> temper alwayes, and yet without queſtion
<hi>Iob</hi> did alwayes beleeve. <hi>Paul</hi> was not in the ſame
temper <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. that he was <hi>Rom. 8. 38. Peters</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Master ſave me, or elſe I periſh,</hi> did argue his
faith was under water more then his head. <hi>Davids</hi>
temper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 1, 2, 3. was not the ſame with his
temper, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. In the firſt he would not bee
afraid of an Hoſt encamping round about, no
though the Hoſt conſiſted of ten thouſand, <hi>Pſal.
3.</hi> 6. But in that place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. tells us hee
was afraid of one <hi>Saul,</hi> and that after many expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences.
So a poor Chriſtian is ready to think, O
I do not truly truſt and rely upon God, &amp;c. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I think if I had not a bit of bread, nor a drop
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41393:100"/>
of water, yet I would not feare, my faith ſhould be
like that <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17. Another time my heart is ſo
farre from it, that though I have for the preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
yet my baſe heart can hardly keep from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe;
ſometimes I think that if God would
take me away in a maſſacre, I ſhould not yeeld my
blood with a repining word; another time I ſo
doubt of my intereſt in Chriſt, that I ſhould not
know how to dye upon my bed, but am crying,
Lord take me not away with the wicked. Chriſtian,
thus thou mayeſt be. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 3. would not
be afraid of his ſoules going out of his body if ten
thouſand ſwords were ready to cut out a paſſage
for his ſoule out of his body. Another time hee
cryes <hi>O ſpare a little, give me ſpace, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
strength before I go from hence, and be no more;</hi>
and again, <hi>Take me not away with the wicked.</hi> One
while <hi>David</hi> is troubled to ſee the wicked <hi>flouriſh
like a green Bay tree;</hi> and himſelfe like a withered
tree without a leafe; another time hee is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at it, but can as well truſt God when he ſends
to <hi>Nabal</hi> for almes, as when he ſits at his Kingly
Table and; yet his faith was alwayes true. Faith may
be interrupted, that the pulſe of it cannot alwayes
beat alike, and yet while there is life the pulſe of
Faith beates, though by reaſon of ſome ſickneſſe
in the ſoule the pulſe may beat more faintly and
deadly then at other times; Corruptions, though
they are never wholly the Chriſtians Maſters, yet
they may be their Maſters ſometimes more then
others; the minde may be more clouded with
earthly thoughts; the tide of paſſions may bee
higher, and the ſtream of Luſts greater; the body
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41393:100"/>
may be ſometimes ſick and leſſe active, and yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
So the ſoule may be ſick, and Faith act
more weakly then at other times, yet Faith may
be alive.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Thou mayest not ſo fully and equally rely
upon ſome promiſes as upon other, and yet truly rely
upon all.</hi> It is a truth, that the true beleever cloſeth
with every promiſe; but it is alſo true, that the
beſt Beleever findes a great deal of difficulty more
for his ſoule to cloſe with and rely upon ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
promiſes then upon others; and a beleever
ſhall finde, if he be put to it, that it is harder to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon God for his promiſes for this life, then
for his promiſes for eternall life; God hath made
promiſes for this life, Earth is made over by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture
to the Saints as well as Heaven, <hi>Mat. 6.
32.</hi> God hath made promiſes of protection in
times of danger, of ſufficiencie in time of peuury;
now a Chriſtian will finde it harder, if he be put to
it for want of bread, to rely upon Gods feeding
promiſes, then upon his promiſes for eternall life;
O it is hard for a poor creature to truſt God for
bread and water. Hence comes diſtruſting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
care, hence covetouſneſſe and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymindedneſſe
in Gods own people. And if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
be ſurrounded with ſwords, and be in the midſt
of dangers, it is a hard thing now confidently and
without feare to rely upon Gods ſhield and buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and truſt himſelfe within the Caſtle of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
I am confident when <hi>David</hi> manifeſted
ſuch an evident diſtruſt of Gods promiſe for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. he did not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
God for ſaving of him; we read not a word
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41393:101"/>
of ſuch a diſtruſt: Now I conceive the reaſon of
it may be two-fold:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe here the fleſh is ſenſible and concerned
in it.</hi> Dangers are obvious to ſenſe; The eye ſees
ſwords and trembles, it ſees preſent dangers; but it
ſees not that ſpeedy reliefe which the promiſes
hold out; it muſt be the ſpiritually enlightned eye
of the ſoul muſt ſee that: <hi>Eliſha's</hi> man could ſee the
mountain about <hi>Eliſha</hi> full of charrets and horſes;
but it was onely <hi>Eliſha</hi> himſelfe that could ſee the
power of God aſſiſting and defending; <hi>Eliſha</hi> was
faine to pray before his man could have the ſcales
fall from his eyes to ſee that; Now for beleeving
thoſe promiſes where fleſh and ſenſe have a ſhare,
and a preſent ſhare, the ſoule will finde it hard;
for though the fleſh will never help the ſoule in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
and reſting upon any promiſe, yet it will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſoul very much, and very often; I appeal to
any of you, whether you have not found it an eaſier
thing to rely upon a promiſe for ſalvation and
ſtrengthning and quickning grace which meerely
concerns the ſoule, then when you have been in
ſome bodily ſtraights, you have found it to rely
upon the promiſes for ſuccour, and ſupport, and
deliverance: As take a married man, that hath a
minde to the warres, poſſibly the man is a very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and couragious man, and values his life at as
cheap a rate as any, but his wife cryes, and keeps a
ſtirre; that if hee were ſingle, though the deſigne
were the ſame, and the danger the ſame, yet hee
findes it ten times more hard, then if hee were to
goe a ſingle man: So the ſoule married to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is ten times more troubled to cloſe with a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41393:101"/>
promiſe, and venture into thickets of a danger, by the
bawlings and fearings of the fleſh, then it would be if
it were to act ſingle in <hi>ſtatu ſeparato,</hi> or then it doth
when it acts clearly for it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a ſecond reaſon may be given of this,
<hi>viz. Becauſe wo may have more cauſe to feare Gods fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his promiſes for this life, and for temporall mercies in
this life, then it hath, or can have, to feare his promiſes
for ſpirituall mercies, and for eternall life.</hi> The ſoule
that findes an heart changed, and walkes with God,
can give no reaſon why it ſhould not beleeve Gods
ſpirituall promiſes; I meane the promiſes for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
mercies, and his promiſes for eternall life.
What reaſon canſt thou give, why thou ſhouldeſt not
beleeve Gods promiſes for pardon of ſinnes? What?
becauſe thou art a backſlider? The promiſe is made
to ſuch, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. Is it becauſe thou haſt an hard heart?
the promiſe is made to ſuch, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19, 20. But now
come and ask the ſoule when dangers are at hand, and
the ſoul is ready to miſtruſt Gods protecting promiſes;
here the ſoule will tell you, Alas! I have been a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding
creature, and though the ſins and backſlidings of
Gods people be no ſufficient reaſon to warrant the
ſoules diſtruſt for ſalvation, yet there is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of reaſon that the ſoul hath from hence why it
ſhould a little fear Gods wonted diſpenſations of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
mercies to it; for this is a ſure rule, that although
when God hath elected and juſtified any, he hath made
a ſure promiſe they ſhall never again be caſt out of his
eternall favour and love, yet for their ſins he will let
them know his anger by withdrawing his temporal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
of love and mercy, in relation to which are
the promiſes of protection and temporall mercies given
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41393:102"/>
to chaſten them with the rods of men, and with the
ſtripes of the children of men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14, 15. See an
experience of this in in <hi>David,</hi> when he had backſliden
ſo far as to commit thoſe two great ſins of Murder and
Adultery, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. David</hi> teſtified his repentance,
and <hi>Nathan ſaid to him, the Lord hath put away thy ſinne,
thou ſhalt not dye,</hi> v. 13. but the ſword ſhould never depart
from his houſe, v. 10. his wives ſhould be given to be
defloured by his Neighbour, v. 11. The childe ſhould
die, v. 15. Now though that <hi>David</hi> could not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
becauſe of this backſliding, diſtruſt Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
for the pardon of his backſliding, yet he could not
reaſonably rely upon his promiſes for the bleſſing of
his houſe with temporall mercies ſo as before. And
thence it is cleare, that a Chriſtian may truly reſt upon
the promiſes for ſalvation, and pardon of his ſinnes,
though he doth not ſo eaſily reſt, nor ſo conſtantly,
nor fully rely upon him for ſome particular promiſes
of temporall mercies.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is this, <hi>Thou mayſt hang tremblingly upon the
promiſes, and yet hang upon them truly.</hi> And there is a
ſeventh, Thou mayſt truly rely, and dwell upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and yet not truly appropriate and peculiarize
them, and dwell on them as thy own portion, to thy
apprehenſion; but of theſe afterwards.</p>

with feare and trembling:</hi> Sure I am, the work of

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41393:103"/>
times, that will baniſh all feare and trembling from
faith, as utterly inconſiſtent with faith, and will deny
any to have faith but ſuch as have got a confident pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
as if palſied hands were no hands; Chriſt
was never ſo cruell to poor diſeaſed ſoules as theſe
are; <hi>Ephraim exalted himſelfe by ſpeaking trembling,
Hoſ.</hi> 13. 1. The woman <hi>feared and trembled, Mar. 5.

<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. And yet I think none in their right wits will
deny that the ſeeds of faith were growing in <hi>Pauls</hi>

man that catcheth hold of ſome twig to ſave his life,
he knowes he is drowned unleſſe he doth it, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hangs truly, and even caſts his whole weight upon
it, and yet without queſtion his heart trembles for fear,
though he cannot but think the bough will beare him;
ſuch is the Beleever; the true Beleever is a poor wretch
that ſeeing himſelfe undone, in a wofull condition,
ſinking to hell, even juſt ſinking, onely ſpies a branch
of the root of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in a promiſe;
upon this he claps hold; here, ſayes he, I will hang; if
this promiſe will beare the weight of a broken undone
ſoule, then I am ſaved; if not, I periſh; then the ſoule
conſiders what burthen it hath to lay upon it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
it is the heavy weight of all its originall and

but <hi>Eſther</hi> when ſhe went in to King <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> had

Firſt, <hi>It may be the deep apprehenſion of miſery that did
precede;</hi> poſſibly the poor ſoule was under a ſpirit of
bondage a long time, and ſhaked in pieces almoſt with
horrour and feare; at laſt God opens a key-hole of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and bids the ſoule look through and ſee a Chriſt
pardoning all its ſinnes, and waſhing it with his
precious blood, and cancelling all its debts, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
away its teares; the ſoule at the juſt opening of
this now ſtands and trembles, fearing leſt the newes
ſhould not to be true, and terrified with thoſe late ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
not conceiving that hell can be ſo ſoon
transformed into heaven. When <hi>Peter</hi> had been in
the Gaole and the priſon, and without queſtion full of
carnall feares, for the next day he was to have been
brought out and have been ſlain, and the Lord juſt in
the nick of time ſent his Angel and delivered him <hi>Act.
12. 9. Peter</hi> could not tell what to think of it, he wiſt
not that was true that was done by the Angel, but
thought that he had ſeen a viſion, he was fain to ſtay a
while before he came to himſelfe,<note place="margin">V. 11.</note> and ſaid, <hi>Now I know
of a ſurety, that God hath ſent his Angel to bring me out:</hi>
So it is with many a poor Beleever, he is in Gaole too,
God hath him in Gaole, and the ſpirit of bondage
keeps him in fetters; and to his thinking there is
ſcarce a minute ſometimes betwixt him and death:
Alas! death were a mercy, but he thinks that there is
not an haires breadth betwixt him and hell; when he
lyes downe at night, he wonders that he doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
in hell in the morning; now when under the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and deepeſt apprehenſions the ſoule hath of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſinking into hell, God beyond all his expectations
ſends his Angel to knock off theſe fetters, and bring it
into the glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God, when
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41393:104"/>
the ſoule, like <hi>Peter,</hi> is ſleeping betwixt two devils as it
thinks, and is bound with two belliſh chaines of terror
and feare, and the ſpirit of bondage keeps the priſon,
and the Angel of the Lords conſolation comes upon
the ſoule, and the light, the glimmering glorious light
of mercy and conſolation ſhineth into this dark, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
priſon, and ſmites the ſoule, and raiſeth it up, and
ſayes, Soule, ariſe, thou art delivered, and makes the
chaines fall off from the Soule, and ſayes to the ſoule,
Poor ſoul, gird up thy ſelf, bind on thy ſandalls, come
ſtand up from the dead, Chriſt ſhall give thee light,
Come, come out of this Hell, caſt thy garments about
thee, &amp;c. no wonder if the ſoule for a while, like <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
wiſt not that this is true which is done, and no
wonder if it ſtep a ſtep or two further before its trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
is over, eſpecially conſidering that theſe terrours
ſeldome are at once, but by degrees abated from the
ſoule; it paſſeth, like <hi>Peter,</hi> through the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ward, through one iron gate of feares, and then
another ſtreet of terrours; I ſay, conſidering this, it is
no great wonder if it be ſome while before the ſoule
ſayes, with <hi>Peter, Now I know of a ſurety, now I know of
a ſurety, that the Lord hath ſent his Angel, and hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
me out of the hand of the Devill, and from all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of Satan:</hi> It is an ordinary thing if a man
hath been drowning, and almoſt drowned, pulld on to
the land, he trembles and quakes at firſt, as if ſtill hee
were in his drowning danger, though he be on the
ſhore; the terrours had ſurprized him before, are not
preſently ſhaken of.</p>
            <p>A ſecond cauſe may be <hi>in regard of ſome holds that
have already failed the ſoule;</hi> Faith is when the ſoule
layes hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, as the twig of ſalvation,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41393:104"/>
and hangs upon him for life, and heaven, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
Now the ſoule hath had many twigs failed:
It is the nature of man to be timerous, and as a drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man will catch hold upon any thing which comes
next hand to ſave his life on; if he catcheth hold on
one, and that breaks, he claps hold on another; if that
again breaks, he claps hold on a third; if that alſo
breakes, he ſtill claps hold on a fourth, beleeving it will
hold; otherwiſe he would never lay hold upon it; yet
ſo many having failed, he cannot but feare leſt
that ſhould faile him too: So it is with a poor ſoule,
ſin hath almoſt drowned him in terrour: firſt he claps
hold upon moralitie and civilitie, reſolving to live a
ſober, and honeſt, and vertuous life, and thinks this will
beare him; well, this twig breakes, and will not hold;
when God hath a minde to work his work upon the
the ſoule, he quickly ſhewes the ſoule that this is a
bruiſed reed, and broken ſtaffe, the ſoule is plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a depth of horror and terror again; well, then hee
claps hold of another twig, and that is his duties, he
prayes and faſts, and here he hangs, this ſhall ſave me
(ſaith he;) this twig alſo breaks, the Lord ſhews the
poor wretch that all its righteouſneſſe is as a menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cloth, and as filthy rags in his ſight, and here the
ſoule is again plunged in feare; at laſt God ſhews the
ſoule the bough of Jeſus Chriſts Righteouſneſſe; the
drowning, ſinking, poor creature layes hold of this but
with trembling leſt this ſhould alſo faile; at firſt it
feares.</p>
            <p>A third cauſe may be <hi>in regard of the promiſe;</hi> Faiths
work is to lay hold upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but
now the ſoule doth not do this immediately; but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.
Chriſt doth not appear and ſpeak out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41393:105"/>
to the ſoule, and ſay, I am thy ſalvation, then the
work of Faith would be more eaſie; but Chriſt hath
given the ſoul many both ſweet and precious promiſes,
and theſe are the cords that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt
throwes out to the ſoule to pull it to the land with:
Now the ſoule takes this but with trembling untill it
hath tryed the ſtrength of them, in regard it conceives
the promiſes are lyable to many ambiguities, bounded
with many conditions and limitations, and the ſoule
conceives it ſelfe either not within the bounds of the
promiſe, or unable to fulfill the conditions of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
or that it may make a falſe application of the
promiſe: And hence it is, that come to a poor droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſoule, that feares its condition, and hath a true,
though a trembling hand of faith (for Faith may have
the palſey) and urge the faithfulneſſe of God in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing,
the ſureneſſe of the promiſe once made, the
unchangeable nature of God; they will tell you, they
do not a jot queſtion this, they know <hi>God is not man
that he ſhould lye; nor yet as the ſon of man that he ſhould
repent;</hi> they know that he is both faithfull and true; but
the promiſes they feare are not made to them; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
reſt upon them, but whether rightly or no, God
knowes; they conceive that either the promiſes were
made to particular perſons, as to the Nation of the
Jewes, or they are ſure to the particular number of
Gods Elect, of which they are none, &amp;c. they will tell
you that indeed the promiſes are true, but they are
conditionall, and they feare that the conditions of the
promiſe are not fulfilled in their ſoules; ſo that the
work lies another way, not ſo much to perſwade them
of the truth of the promiſes in generall, the cauſe of
their trembling lies not here for feare that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41393:105"/>
ſhould faile thoſe to whom it belongs, but for
feare that they ſhould miſapply and miſunderſtand the
faithfull and true promiſes of God: And now although
we muſt ſay concerning this trembling, <hi>this is alſo our
infirmity,</hi> yet none can deny that it is an hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
to the nature of man, and will be in us more or
leſſe, ſo long as any of us be in the fleſh, and ſo long as
ſinne remaines in our fleſh, and will be eſpecially and
moſt in thoſe that have lien under greateſt feares and
terrours, and are newly got out of them, and begin to
have a little of the light of comfort glimmer upon
them; even as a man that ſhould come out of an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and dark dungeon where he hath been in darkneſſe,
thick darkneſſe, into the glaring ſight of the Sun in
the top of the Meridian, at the firſt will be dazeled, and
rub his eyes, and apprehend himſelf in ſome darkneſſe,
though he be in the light. He that had his eyes opened
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. firſt thought he ſaw men like trees; and this trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
may conſiſt with true dependance. <hi>Iob. 13. 15.
Though he kill me, yet I will trust in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the laſt words
<hi>yet I will truſt in him,</hi> argued faith, and a ſtrong faith;
faith that he would truſt; a ſtrong faith, that yet hee
would truſt; and yet whoſo conſidereth the firſt words
that <hi>Iob</hi> apprehended himſelf in a danger of killing,
will eaſily think that it was a trembling faith that <hi>Iob</hi>
there acted. And as it is ordinary with poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
through their infirmity to beleeve tremblingly in
the beginning of their converſion; ſo there is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time when trembling doth ordinarily accompany
true faith in the people of God, and that is a time of
deſertion. Secondly in time of deſertion I think none
will deny but Gods children have, and act, and muſt
act true faith in this ſaving and juſtifying act of reliance
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41393:106"/>
and dependency; but I am ſure this they cannot doe
without trembling: Such was the condition of <hi>Iob</hi> in
that place I before mentioned <hi>Iob 13. 15. David</hi> did
rely, and ſtrongly rely in his time of deſertion, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that in his 6. Pſalm, v. 8. he ſpeakes confidently
of a thing that he beleeved for as if it were already
done, <hi>The Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping;</hi> and
yet whoſoever readeth but the former part of that
Pſalm, will finde that he was in a trembling temper,
His ſoule was ſore vexed, his bones were troubled, he
was weary with his groaning, and he made his bed to
ſwim with his teares, &amp;c. Now the cauſe of this trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
ariſeth;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>from the ſenſe of the ſinne;</hi> The ſinner ſaith, <hi>Ah!
the promiſes did belong to me; but I have been a backſlider,
and now what have I to doe with the promiſes? What hath
ſuch a wretch as I to doe with theſe filthy unclean hands of
mine to lay hold upon a clean Chriſt?</hi> The ſenſe of ſin
ſtrikes a deep impreſſion upon the ſoule, and puts a
ſhaking into the heart of the ſoule; yet it layes hold;
if Chriſt will not ſave me (ſaith the poor ſoule) ſure I
am nothing elſe can; to him I will go, and me thinks
it goes as the Meſſengers of <hi>Benhadad</hi> to <hi>Ahab 1 King.
20. Behadad</hi> there had wrong'd <hi>Ahab,</hi> and through the
help of God his Army was routed, and <hi>Benhadad</hi> was
glad to hide himſelfe in one of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Townes in an
inner Chamber, and ſends to <hi>Ahab;</hi> his ſervants, v. 31.
ſaid to him, <hi>We have heard that the Kings of the houſe
of Iſrael are mercifull Kings, let us put ſackcloth on our
loynes, and put ropes about our heads, and go out to the
King of Iſrael; peradventure he will ſave thy life;</hi> ſo they
did, and ſaid, <hi>Thy ſervant Benhadad ſayes,</hi> I <hi>pray thee
let me live; And he ſaid, is he yet alive? he is my brother;</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:41393:106"/>
the men catcht his words, and they ſaid, <hi>Thy brother
Benhadad;</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Go and bring him;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he came, and <hi>Ahab</hi> took him up into his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot:
So it is with the poor ſoule, when the ſoule
hath fought againſt God by ſin, the Lord overthrowes
it by deſertion, yet it lives, but dare not be ſeen ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
it is hidden under the dark cloud of deſertion, it
ſquilks as in an inner chamber, it is ſenſible how it hath
deſerved death, yea ten thouſand deaths; But the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
of grace being yet in the ſoule, it ſayes within it ſelfe,
I have heard that the King of Heaven, the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, is a mercifull Chriſt; come therefore, I will
ſend my Meſſengers of Faith and Prayer, they ſhall put
ſackcloth-upon their loynes, and ropes upon their
heads, and go out to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
he will ſave my ſoule, and I ſhall live. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
queſtion <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants went with trembling
hearts, and yet relied upon this as the onely meanes to
ſave <hi>Benhadad</hi> their Maſter alive: So the ſoule ſends
out at ſuch a time a trembling faith, and trembling
prayers, and yet truly relies upon Chriſts mercy, and
favour, and the ſoule ſayes to God; <hi>Lord! thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding,
revolting ſervant ſayes, Let me live, let my back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings
be healed, let my renewed ſinnes be yet pardoned:</hi>
Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Thou art my brother,</hi> and take thee into
the Charret; but yet thy faith trembles, and thy prayer
trembles: And indeed there is very great reaſon for it,
if we ſecondly <hi>conſider, that the very eſſence of deſertions
is Gods withdrawing of his manifeſtative love from the ſoul,
that the ſoul, though it be loved with Gods elective love in
and under deſertions, yet it wants the apprehenſions and
manifeſtations of his love:</hi> Now, that which onely can
keep the ſoule from its naturall temper of trembling,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41393:107"/>
is the apprehended manifeſtations of Chriſts love to
it, which being withdrawn, the ſoule falls a trembling
again, and yet the life of grace being not extinct, it
ſtill truſts, yea though he kills the ſoule, yet it truſts
in him. So I have done with the ſixth propoſition,
That the ſoule may depend tremblingly upon the Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and yet depend truly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come now to the ſeventh and laſt Propoſition, to
ſhew what weakneſſe and doubting may conſiſt with
true faith in the ſoule: that I ſhall doe in a ſeventh
propoſition thus,</hi> Thou mayest truly rely and depend upon
the promiſes of God, and upon the Lord Ieſus Christ for
everlasting ſalvation, and dwell upon them, and yet not
be able fully and truly to appropriate and peculiarize all
the promiſes to thy ſelfe, and act accordingly to them at all
times. <hi>There are</hi> diſtinctions of promiſes <hi>and</hi> diſtinctions
of times, <hi>from whence will ariſe diſtinctions of cauſes,
which would be underſtood; To make out this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>You muſt know that there is a diſtinction of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
the promiſes are many wayes diſtinguiſhed; there
are <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>particular promiſes, abſolute</hi> and <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
promiſes,</hi> Promiſes that <hi>concerne ſome particular peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
as the people of the Iews, and <hi>particular perſons,</hi> as
to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Herekiah,</hi> and other of the people of
God, which if we ſhould apply, we ſhould miſapply
to our ſelves: I ſhall not meddle with all the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe promiſes, but onely with what ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
now to my purpoſe to make out this truth I
have laid down in my propoſition, and ſo I ſhall diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of two promiſes, two wayes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are temporall or ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are abſolute or conditionall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:41393:107"/>
Firſt, <hi>there are temporall promiſes,</hi> which are or may be
called temporall, <hi>either in reſpect of the matter of the
promiſe, or circumstance of time limited in the promiſe.</hi>
There are ſome promiſes that were made for a certaine
time, and at the time expired were paid, and now the
bonds are cancell'd, theſe were particular: Such were
many promiſes made to the people of the Iewes, and
to particular perſons amongſt them; <hi>Now theſe wee
must not look to peculiarize,</hi> and appropriate to our
ſelves, they are done with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>There are temporall promiſes ſo called in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the things promiſed,</hi> being things temporall for
the body or eſtate, for protection of our ſelves, wives,
eſtates, families: Now for theſe promiſes, <hi>thou mayſt
not peculiarize them, and yet have true faith for ſalvation;
ſalvation and heaven being not the thing promiſed in them;</hi>
and beſides, there may be cauſe why thou mayeſt not
have ſo good ground to rely, and confidently reſt upon
God for the fulfilling of theſe promiſes, as I ſhall ſhew
you more when I come to handle the diſtinction of
times, and as I ſhewed you the laſt time, in the caſe of
<hi>David 2 Sam.</hi> 12. But ſecondly there is a ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of promiſes, I meane of <hi>ſpirituall promiſes,</hi>
which it is our duty at all times to apply and reſt upon;
yet theſe are either <hi>abſolute</hi> or <hi>conditionall:</hi> It is a note
that I have before ſomewhere noted, that the promiſes
of Gods firſt mercies in a way of ſaving grace to the
ſoule are ordinarily abſolute; <hi>I will give, and I will give,</hi>
without any praevious conditions to be found in the
ſoule, as his promiſes of <hi>inlightning grace,</hi> Jer. 24. v. 7.
<hi>I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord,
and they ſhall be people, and I will be their God:</hi> And
for the grace of humiliation, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41393:108"/>
alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put upon you;
and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and
will give you an heart of fleſh;</hi> and ſo <hi>for his grace by which
he convinceth, Ioh. 16. 8. The ſpirit ſhould convince the
world of ſinne, of righteouſneſse, and of judgement:</hi> Now
theſe promiſes are altogether abſolute, being the free
promiſes for diſpenſations of the firſt graces in order
to a poor ſoules ſalvation: Now there are other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of God for ſpirituall mercies in order to the
ſoules ſalvations, which are ſecond diſpenſations, and
theſe are propounded with conditions, as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of heaven for power to rely on Jeſus Chriſt, peace,
aſſurance, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Mat.</hi> 11. 29. and again, <hi>to him
that overcometh will I give to drink of the water of life
freely,</hi> with many ſuch more; not as if man could ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
theſe conditions in the ſoule, and prepare his owne
heart; No, we abhorre that Popiſh doctrine, though
ſome falſly charge us with it: But becauſe Chriſt wil
fulfill them, before he beſtowes thoſe higher degrees
of mercy and favour upon them; he will make the ſoul
hunger and thirſt before hee will let it know it
ſhall live,<note place="margin">Iſ. 55<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> and give it power to come unto him;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 9.</note> hee
will make the ſoule weary and heavie laden with ſin,
before he will give the ſoule power to rely upon him
comfortably for ſalvation:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zek. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>He will take away the heart
of ſtone out of the ſoule, and give it an heart of fleſh,</hi> before
he will give it power <hi>to walk in his ſtatutes, and keep his
ordinances, and do them,</hi> before he will let it know that
he is its God, and that it is Gods choſen veſſell. And
thus I have ſhewed you the diſtinction of promiſes;
and what we ſhall conclude from hence for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I will ſhew you by and by when I have done with
the diſtinction of times, which I come to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:41393:108"/>
               <hi>The Soule hath its winter and ſummer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> its cloudy and
black dayes, and its lightſome and glaring dayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it hath its lightſome, ſummer Sun ſhine dayes,
when it is not conſcious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of any great ſinne committed against knowledge,
<hi>ſuch as</hi> Tertullian <hi>calls</hi> Peccata devorantia ſalutem;
<hi>Sinnes that ſwallow up heaven and ſalvation in the
ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>When it hath no naturall diſtempers of body,</hi> no
cloudy, melancholy vapours; for the ſoule being to
act through the body, doth ſomething ſuffer by it:
and as it is with a man that looks at the reflection
of his face in a glaſſe, if there be a wetneſſe or duſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the glaſſe, he cannot ſee clearly: So the ſoule if
there be a miſt or duſt of melancholy oppreſſes the
body, the ſoule cannot ſee and act clearly.</p>
            <p>Or 3. <hi>When the body is not under ſome harſh affliction;</hi>
for the ſoule ſympathi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth with the body, and in its
acting through the organs of it, ſhewes the affection
that it hath with the bodies ſufferings; and ſo alſo
there are black and dark dayes; for as it is ſummer
time with the ſoule and day-light when it is not
ſad and darkned with deſertion, and when the
body is not oppreſſed with melancholly, or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or perſecution; So on the contrary it is winter,
and a dark time with the ſoule, when the ſoule hath
ſinned ſome great ſinne, for which the ſoule looks up
trembling to God, and looks upon him as an angry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull
God, or when the body is heavy and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with melancholy vapours ſtopping the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the ſoule, or under heavy and grievous affliction
that it is born down even to a back-breaking under
them; even as it is with a fountaine that runs through
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41393:109"/>
Conduit-pipes of lead, &amp;c. or wood, into any houſe,
if the fountaine be dirty, and muddy in it ſelf, dirty wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comes into the houſe; or if the Conduit-pipes
through which it paſſeth be dirty and tainted, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bringeth the pollution and tang of bitterneſſe, &amp;c.
that was in the pipe, into the houſe; otherwiſe, if both
the fountaine be cleare and ſweet, and the Conduit-pipes
be not ſtopped, nor tainted, nor dirty, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
water runs ſweetly into the place to which the Pipes
lead it: So it is with the ſoule that is the fountaine
that runs into acts, but through the Conduit-pipes of
the body; if the pipes be ſtopt, or oppreſſed, or mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or cleare, ſuch is the actings of the ſoule. And
thus I have ſhewed you the diſtinctions both of times
and promiſes; now I ſhall conclude the truth of this
propoſition in ſome four or five Concluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Particular promiſes muſt not be expected to
be peculiarized;</hi> we may not expect that thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which were made to the people of the Jewes in
particular, ſhould be made good to us, becauſe they had
promiſes to be delivered out of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> at
ſuch a prefixt time; it were madneſſe in us to beleeve
that the Church of God ſhould be now delivered juſt
after 70. years, or 400. years; and ſo likewiſe what
promiſes were made to any particular perſons amongſt
the Jewes, as for any now to apply that promiſe made
to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> I will adde to thy life 15. years: I think
we have a rule here in Land <hi>That if an inheritance be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
by name, it cannot be tranſlated to any other;</hi> theſe
promiſes were entail'd by name; theſe thou canſt not,
nay oughtſt not to apply, they are not a portion by thy
father deſign'd for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may poſsibly be that in ſome times thou
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41393:109"/>
mayeſt not be able to appropriate the temporall promiſes that
God hath made to his children, amongst which thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the darke time of want and penury to beleeve for
bread to eate when I ſee none like to come; O it is hard
feeding upon Scripture leaves:</hi> I ſhewed you this the
laſt day, 'tis nothing to doe it, or at leaſt to think
we doe it in times of proſperity. <hi>Habakuks</hi> faith, <hi>Hab.
3.</hi> 17. was an hard faith, though it were a ſtrong and
precious one.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In the dark time of deſertions,</hi> It is hard, as I
ſhall ſhew you by and by, to apply thoſe promiſes that
are of neereſt concernment to our ſalvation, much more
thoſe which are at ſo remote a diſtance.</p>
            <p>3. In a time when melancholy, dark, cloudy vapours of
the body caſt a wiſt before the ſoules eye, <hi>and will not give
it leave to act clearly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In a time when the ſoule hath ſinned, thou mayeſt not
fully rely and be ſo confident, as before.</p>
            <p>To peculiarize theſe promiſes, I ſhewed you the
ground of this before, becauſe though God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
that his Saints ſhall never eternally fall out of
his favour, yet he hath and will puniſh his Saints for
ſinne, with the ſubſtraction of temporall favors, as I
ſhewed you before in the caſe of <hi>David;</hi> and I take
that to be an old Antinomian errour, inſtead of a new
truth, <hi>That God doth not with temporall afflictions cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectively
puniſh his beſt ſervants for ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It doth not argue a nullity of faith, and true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith, at any time not to be able to appropriate out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
temporall promiſes;</hi> for although it is our duty to
rely and depend upon all the promiſes; yet if wee
through infirmity be not able to rely upon theſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41393:110"/>
it doth not null the verity of our faith, ſalvation
being not the thing promiſed in theſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>For thoſe that are conditionall promiſes in
dark times, the ſoule may not be able clearly and fully to
apply them, reſt upon them, and particularly apply them, and
yet at the ſame time truly dwell and reſt upon them.</hi> What
ſpirituall promiſes are made conditionally in Scripture,
I have ſhewed you before; now it may poſſibly be, that
even theſe, though of great concernment to the ſoule,
yet at all times the ſoule may not be able to ſay, this
promiſe of Heaven and glory and happineſſe belongs
to me.<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 7, 8, 9.</note> Holy <hi>Aſaph</hi> in a dark day with his ſoule, may
ſay, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
no more? Is his mercy cleane gone for ever? Doth
his promiſe faile for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be
gracious? Hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies?</hi>
The reaſon lies not, that the ſoule doubts of the truth
of God in his promiſes at all; no, it verily thinketh,
that if it had fulfilled the conditions of the promiſes,
the promiſes would remaine to its ſoule as ſtedfaſt as
Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> but it cannot ſee <hi>that:</hi> It looks upon its
ſinnes in a multiplying glaſſe, and upon its repentance
in a diminiſhing glaſſe. Every mountaine of good in
its ſelfe now ſeemes a Mole-hill, and every Mole-hill
of ſinnes ſeemeth a Mountaine unto it: Thence it is
that in the ſoules dark day of afflictions in the ſoule,
or in a dark day of afflictions to the body, the ſoules
faith is weakned, it is ready to look upon its great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
as an evidence that it wanteth that intereſt in
God which it ſhould have to apply promiſes: It ſayes
with <hi>Gideon, Iudg.</hi> 6. 13. when the promiſe ſaith like
the Angel, <hi>The Lord is with thee;</hi> it anſwers, <hi>O my Lord!
if the Lord be with me, why then is all this be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:41393:110"/>
and where be all his mercies? no, the Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
me, and delivered me to the hand of Satan; now
the ſoule muſt not take a judgement of its faith from
hence, but appeale <hi>abanima perturbata ad animam qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etam</hi>
to a calm day in the ſoule again.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>In dark times the truly beleeving ſoule (though
it can give no reaſon for it) may not be able to reſt, and apply
the moſt abſolute peculiar promiſes as its peculiar portion;</hi>
this I ſhall fully make out by conſidering what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

laſt Propoſition I left imperfect;
it was (as you may remember) this,
That a gracious ſoule may truly rely upon the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and upon his promiſes for
eternall life, and yet not be able at all times fully
and truely to appropriate and peculiarize all the
promiſes to its ſelf: This I ſhewed in foure Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

the promiſe muſt appear to the ſoule as a ſalve
having a full efficacie and vertue in it for the healing
of its ſore, otherwiſe the ſoule can never apply it;
now it may poſſibly be, that thy non-application of the
promiſe may proceed from thy not underſtanding the

power, and efficacie of the promiſe; poſſibly thou
mayeſt underſtand the promiſe to be made particular,
when it is propounded generall; and ſuch have I my
ſelfe ſometimes met with, that being under afflictions
of ſpirit, when I have propounded a promiſe to them,
as a ſalve fit for their ſore, they have evaded that way;
<hi>Ah! but that promiſe was made to the Iewes, or to ſuch, or to

ſuch a particular perſon; it was a plaiſter ſpread for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers

and with ſuch cavils have ſtood at a diſtance from the

ſhall give a rule or two: The firſt is remarkable, I find
it in a reverend Author, which I ſhall deliver in his
words with a little limitation, thus, <hi>Generall promiſes
for ſpirituall mercies are alwayes to be applyed particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and particular promiſes for ſpirituall and temporall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are to be applyed generally;</hi> I call thoſe generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
which are either <hi>made to Gods people in generall,</hi>
or concerning <hi>ſpirituall things in generall;</hi> as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
God had made a generall promiſe to any that
ſhould pray toward his Temple, 1 <hi>King. 8. 37. 40. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi>
being after in diſtreſſe,<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 3<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

promiſe to his owne particular condition, 1 <hi>Chron.
20.</hi> 8. 10.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 20 8. 10.</note> And without queſtion it was from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

               <hi>Dan. 6.
10.</hi> and ſo for thoſe promiſes which are made to the
people of God for ſpirituall mercies in generall,<note place="margin">Pſa. 84. 11.</note> ſuch
is that promiſe, <hi>Pſal. 84. 11. He will give grace and
glory, and no good thing will be with-hold from them that
live uprightly,</hi> ought to be applyed for any ſpirituall
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41393:112"/>
good thing,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 12.</note> or particular diſpenſation of grace. So
the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 12. would have the twelve Tribes
under temptations apply thoſe generall promiſes of a
crowne of life made unto Gods people that endure any
affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions, to their particular ſufferings in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and under their particular temptations. And
<hi>for thoſe promiſes that are particular, they are alſo to bee
generally applyed;</hi> as for that particular promiſe made
to <hi>Moſes, Exod</hi> 4. v. 12. I will be with thy mouth, and
teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay; it cannot be literally
applyed to every Chriſtian, particularly that at all
times God will be with him in going into <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
teach him what to ſay (for he is not call'd to go in)
but thus, it may and ought to be applyed by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Chriſtian, That when God cals him to a publike
ſervice, and he finds a warrantable calling, and an ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
he may by faith particularly rely upon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
though not by a particular application, for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
juſt at ſuch a time and in ſuch a manner as the
promiſe was made good to <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet in generall for
ſome kind of aſſiſtance in the undergoing of his works;
and ſuch a generall application Chriſt warrants every
particular Apoſtle to make of that promiſe, as you
may ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 13. v. 11. And ſo for that particular
promiſe which was made to <hi>Iacob</hi> going to <hi>Padan-Aram,
Gen. 28. 15. Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I am with thee,
and will keep thee in all places whitherſoever thou goeſt, &amp;c.</hi>
A Chriſtian cannot now particularly apply this ſo as
to reſolve upon going to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> leaning on the
ſtaffe of this promiſe: But as there is no warrant for
ſuch a particular application, ſo neither ought this to
be rejected as a promiſe of no concernment to a
Chriſtian, but to be generally applyed; and thus far
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41393:113"/>
every particular Chriſtian may apply this, <hi>viz.</hi> when he
is called to take an hazzardous and dangerous journey,
he may apply this promiſe for Gods protection of him
in it; and this Chriſt warranted to us <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 11. 20.
Praying that God in keeping up their faith, would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
that Promiſe which he had made to <hi>Peter,</hi>

            <p>This is one Rule which will help thee to underſtand
the full extent and vertue of the promiſes, and this you

            <p>1. That thoſe promiſes which for ſpirituall mercies God
hath made to his people in generall, have ſuch vertue in
them, that we may in times of need particularly apply them
to our ſoules. <hi>As for example, that promiſe,</hi> Hoſea 14.
4. I will heale their backſlidings, and love them freely: <hi>It
was made to the people of God in generall: Now a
Chriſtian that hath been a backſlider, may reſt upon
this as his proper and peculiar portion? and ſo for
other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That thoſe promiſes which are made for grace and
ſpirituall good things in generall, may and ought to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
applyed to our ſoules for any ſpeciall good thing, or
any particular diſpenſation of grace which our ſoules want:</hi>
As ſuppoſe I want faith, and I am to pray for it; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is but ſuing a Bond; where ſhall I have a promiſe
to ground my prayer for this diſpenſation of Grace,
poſſibly I cannot finde out, or call to mind any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
promiſe, for that diſpenſation of grace, yet I
may apply that promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. or <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10.
where God hath made a promiſe of all grace to his
people, if he hath promiſed to give all, then will hee
give that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:41393:113"/>
3. <hi>That thoſe promiſes which are made to particular
perſons, and for particular occaſions, or for particular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
though I cannot particularly apply them in that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and with thoſe particular circumstances with which

particular vertue for me:</hi> As ſuppoſe that I be haled to
priſon, and be to be called before Magiſtrates, and be
afraid I ſhall not be able to carry my ſelfe ſo as to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
the cauſe of God; and I cannot remember any
promiſe made to the people of God in that condition;
I may ſo farre apply that promiſe which was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
made to <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Andrew,
Mark</hi> 13. 3. 11. as to rely upon God, either to keep
me from appearing before them, or to be with mee
when I am before them, &amp;c. If I be to take a long
journey, and for the preſent poſſibly cannot finde a
promiſe in generall of Gods protection to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
I may rely upon that particular promiſe made to
<hi>Iacob, Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other protect me and provide for me, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Rule is this, <hi>Whatſoever promiſes thou
findest in the Word of God made to any particular people,
for ſpirituall and ſoul-mercies, thou mayeſt apply to the
ſtill continuing Church and any member thereof;</hi> thoſe
promiſes which were made to the Jewes, are good to
Gentiles; thoſe which were made to them and their

us and our ſeed: This the Apoſtle evidently makes
good, <hi>Act. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and unto your children, and unto thoſe that are afarre off</hi>
[That is, the Gentiles] <hi>even as many as the Lord our
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41393:114"/>
God ſhall call;</hi> and the Apoſtle urgeth this in ſeverall
places; he ſpeaks of the Corinthians, as having and
being poſſeſſed of the Promiſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. and <hi>Peter</hi>
writing to ſcattered ſtrangers, ſaith 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 4. To us are
given many great and precious promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. And this thou mayeſt be ſure of, if thou doſt but
conſider,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That that God that hath promiſed, is an immutable
God,</hi> he is the ſame God to all the faithfull, with him
there is no ſhadow of change.</p>
            <p>2. If thou doſt but conſider, <hi>That the promiſes made
to the Iewes, were not made to them under the notion of
Iewes, but under the notion of beleevers, as they were the
faithfull people of God.</hi> Indeed the promiſes in <hi>Geneſis</hi>
are many made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his children, and ſeed;
But (as you have lately heard by my reverend Brother
in another place, upon another ſubject) <hi>Abraham</hi> had
a <hi>ſtarry ſeed,</hi> and a <hi>duſty ſeed,</hi> according to Gods two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
promiſe, <hi>I will make thy ſeed as the duſt of the earth;</hi>
and again, <hi>I will make them as the ſtarres of heaven:</hi> Now
the promiſe is not made to <hi>Abrahams duſty ſeed,</hi> to the
bare children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, but
to the <hi>ſtarry ſeed,</hi> to all the faithfull: This was all the
Jewes brag: O! we are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to
us belong the Law and the Promiſes, and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
&amp;c. But our Saviour Chriſt decideth this
queſtion, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 8. 39. If ye were Abrahams children, you
would doe the works of Abraham;</hi> that is, if you were the
children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the faith (his ſtarry
children;) thoſe Beleevers that do the works of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and beleeve with the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are
the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom the promiſe is made;
<hi>Gal. 3. 29. And if ye be Chriſts</hi> [that is, ſuch as by faith
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41393:114"/>
are united to Chriſt] <hi>then are yee Abrahams ſeed, and
heires according to the Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will be further evident, if you conſider in
the third place, <hi>That the whole Covenant, of which every
promiſe is but a branch or member, was made originally and
primarily with the Lord Ieſus Christ for all beleevers, Gal.

<hi>he was the ſecond Adam. Now as the Covenant of works

Chriſtian, thy particular applying faith here is hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41393:117"/>
no condition of a promiſe which he hath not promiſed to
fulfill in us;</hi> And whatſoever ſpirituall action is any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
required of us as a duty, he hath ſomewhere
promiſed to beſtow upon us as a diſpenſation of free
Grace. Therefore I would have the ſoule in ſuch a
condition, when it ſtumbles at the condition of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
ſeek out thoſe promiſes where God promiſeth
to fulfill thoſe conditions in it, and particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them and rely upon God for making them good,
and direct its prayers accordingly. So I have done
with the firſt thing required in the Soule for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
application of the promiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> a cleare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the promiſes, for which I have given
three Rules; Now in regard that at all times there may
be in a true beleeving ſoule a clear underſtanding of
the promiſes: I conclude there may be true faith in
the ſoule that at all times cannot make a particular
Application; But I haſten to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which is requiſite in that ſoule
that doth truly rely, or that can particularly apply
the promiſes, and that is <hi>a cleare underſtanding of its
own condition;</hi> for how can I truly and particularly
apply a promiſe to the wound of my Soule, when I
do not underſtand truly what wound my ſoule hath?
Now, a true believing ſoule may have a very falſe
eſtimate of its own condition: Thus had <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Aſaph,</hi> and the Church, they thought they were caſt
off <hi>Pſal. 43. 2. Pſal. 44. 9. Pſal. 60. 1. Pſal. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 1.
77,</hi> 7, 89, 38. Now if I think that a part of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is gangrened, I will never apply Phyſick to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know it is in vaine: ſo, ſo long as the Soule
conceives that its condition is irrecoverable, its ſins
unpardonable, that applying promiſes to it is but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41393:117"/>
warm clothes to a dead man; it will never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
Now ſuch a temper may be in the beleeving
Soule occaſioned by the violent temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
by dark clouds of melancholy, or the like: it
apprehends its ſinns nor pardonable, or at leaſt not
pardonable as yet to the ſoule. O! (ſayes the ſoule)
<hi>I have ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt what good will it
do to me to apply promiſes? I am dammed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a temptation which Sathan ordinarily firſt or
laſt troubles beleeving ſoules with: I have anſwered
that caſe of Conſcience particularly, and therefore
ſhall not enter into a particular diſcourſe of it now.
Now till the ſoule be brought ſo farr truly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
its own condition, that its wounds are curable
and to cry unto God for the healing and cure of them;
it cannot be expected that it ſhould particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
any Promiſes, as pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſters for the healing; and in
regard I ſay that there may be ſome misjudging of
the ſoules true eſtate in a gracious ſoule, there may
alſo be a want of this peculiar faith; It is true, it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by all ſober Divines as the leaſt degree of Faith
to beleeve that my ſins are pardonable, and to run and
fly, and cry unto God for a pardon of them: but yet
through the diſtemperature of the ſoule, even this
thing, that the ſoules ſins are pardonable, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
beleeved, and is the ſoules foundation upon
which ground it humbles it ſelf, and cries and prayes,
may not be beleeved by the ſoule that yet hath true
Faith, or at leaſt beleeved very darkly, and with a
great deale of doubting.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt thing which I will inſtance
in, which muſt be found in that ſoule that ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
apply a generall promiſe as its particular
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41393:118"/>
portion, <hi>is a conſtant wonderfull working of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Spirit of God upon the ſoule:</hi> For let a ſoule never
ſo truly underſtand its own condition, and never ſo
truly underſtand the vertue of the promiſe, and never
ſo fully conceive that the promiſes have an adequate
proportionable vertue for the healing of its particular
wounds; yet unleſſe the ſpirit of God by a wonderfull
powerfull worke of grace doth lay the ſalve upon the
ſore, and apply the promiſe unto the ſoule, it cannot be
done; as it is with a man that hath loſt his hands or the
uſe of them, and ſuppoſe him to have a ſorein his back;
let him never ſo truly underſtand the nature of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
and the vertue of the ſalve with which the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
is ſpread that is to be applied to the ſore, hee is
not able yet to apply it and lay it on for cure; the hand
of the Chirurgeon or ſome other for him muſt doe
this;<note place="margin">Ro. 8. 16.</note> So it is with the Soule, <hi>Ro. 8. 16. The Spirit
it ſelf must beare witneſſe with our ſpirits, that wee are

Now in regard that the Saints and Servants of God
may, though they alwayes have the ſpirit dwelling in
them, yet ſometimes have the Spirit not ſo fully and
powerfully acting in them the ſtrong and powerfull act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Spirit, it being the effects of Gods manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive
love which may be more or leſſe in a Chriſtian,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41393:118"/>
though his elective love admits of no degrees: I ſay
in this regard I conceive a Chriſtian may have true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith, and yet not for the preſent at all times bee
able to apply the promiſes with a particular Faith as
its owne proper and peculiar portion. And now you
have heard the reaſons, which may be reduced ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus:</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe there may be a miſunderſtanding or a
cleare ignorance of the vertue of the promiſes, which
muſt be underſtood before they can bee particularly
applyed.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe there may be a miſunderſtanding of the
ſoules condition: it may ſay there is no hope, and
judge its wounds incurable.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe there may want ſuch a conſtant power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
working of the Spirit of God in the ſoule as muſt
be joyned with the ſoules peculiar application, and yet
there may be true faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt, I conceive</hi> the particular applying of the
promiſe with a confidence, they are my portion, doth argue a
ſenſe of faith, which may not be in the ſoule, and yet true
faith be in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe as a man muſt not be judged to be
no man, becauſe he wants his power to act reaſon in a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
So the eſtimate of the truth of faith that is in the
ſoule, muſt not be taken in the diſtemperature of the ſoule,
<hi>when under heavy temptations; or ſecondly, dark
and melancholy apprehenſions; or thirdly, overpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
afflictions; or fourthly, ſad deſertions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe there is a difference between reſting

               <head type="sub">Concerning thoſe weakneſſes that may accompany the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

ſoule that ſcruples its faith, becauſe it cannot be aſſured
at all, or weakly and unconſtantly.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y ſubject is to diſcover what doubts
and weakneſſe may be in relation
to the laſt and higheſt act of Faith
in a gracious ſoule; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ordinary then to heare
ſuch complaints as theſe from a
gracious ſoule:</hi> Alas! never tell me
of faith, I have no opinion at all that ever I ſhall be ſaved;
never did poor ſoule live at ſuch incertainties; I pray,
I look upward, I deſire, I faint, I groan, I ſwoon, and yet
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41393:120"/>
not a drop of cordiall water of perſwaſion that my Chriſt
will afford me to revive my dying ſpirit; or if I do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
catch up a perſwaſion in my ſoule, and come to think
that I have an intereſt in God, it is but a bare thought,
and ſo weake, that it is ſcarce able to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>nd a day; ſometimes
indeed for a day, or a week, or a month together, <hi>I</hi> could
bleſſe my ſoule in a good condition; but then againe, I am
as full of doubts and feares; and is there any certainty in
this faith? am I not like a wave of the Sea, toſt about
with thouſands of winds? One while I think I am ſure of
heaven and glory, and am as it were wrapt up into a third
heaven, and the diademe of glory is fitting on to my head,
another while I am thrown down to hell, and me thinks
every Devill is tracing mee. <hi>I will (with the help
of my God) endeavavor to ſatisfie thee, and ſhew
thee what weakneſſe may conſiſt with this act, and in
relation to this act of Faith, in theſe enſuing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concluſ. 1. <hi>Thou wayſt have a true and certaine faith,
and ſuch a one as will richly ſave thee, and yet have no
aſſurance of thy ſalvation.</hi> Indeed, my ſeverall Sermons
that I preacht upon this Subject, doe all concurre to the
proofe of this truth; for if a Chriſtian may have ſaving
Faith, and yet ſo much weakneſſe and doubting conſiſt
and be contemporaneous with it in the ſoule, it will
neceſſarily follow, that Aſſurance is not the <hi>minimum
quod ſic,</hi> the leaſt degree of ſaving Faith. But now it
lying in my way, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
to it. There are Opinions on the right
hand and on the left concerning this ſublime act of
our Faith.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Papiſt denies any poſsibility of Aſſurance,</hi> and
reviles that pretious Doctrine as licentious; and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41393:120"/>
pleads only for a generall faith, to believe the hiſtory
of the Word, and the Articles of Faith &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Antinomians on the other ſide, deny any Faith to
be true Faith that is accmpanied with any kind of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
a full aſſurance they will make the <hi>minimum
quod ſic,</hi> the leaſt Faith that can help a man to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Some Reverend Writers living neare the time of
the reign of that Popiſh Doctrine, denying anything
of perſwaſion to come into the nature of true ſaving
Faith, and ſetting themſelves in full oppoſition to it,
have not a little (though unwillingly) contributed to
the laſt opinion, defining Faith <hi>to be a perſwaſion of the
pardon of our ſins, and of a pardon paſt and done &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already ſhewed you, that the eſſence and
marrow of juſtifying Faith conſiſts in the ſoules rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it ſelfe and relying upon God for eternall ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not in the ſoules aſſurance that God is its God;
in the ſoules goings out, not in its commings in; in
its direct act, not in its reflect act; And therefore our
Divines make a diſtinction betwixt a ſoules <hi>applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its ſelf to the promiſe,</hi> and <hi>a ſoules application of
the promiſe to it ſelfe,</hi> and grant that there may bee in
the ſoule a certainty of Faith in reſpect of the object,
though not an aſſurance of Faith in reſpect of the
ſubject. Wee will a little enquire how perſwaſion
comes into the nature of juſtifying Faith. There is a
double diſtinction, which I have noted before, and ſhall
here repeat, would be obſerved concerning this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt there is a difference betwixt a <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> and
a <hi>beleeved Perſwaſion,</hi> on a <hi>full Perſwaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly there is a great deale of difference betwixt
a <hi>perſwaſion eying the future,</hi> and <hi>relating to the preſent;</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41393:121"/>
There may be in a gracious ſoule a perſwaſion, though
he ſayes he is not perſwaded; There is a great deale
of difference betwixt <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>feeling
of Faith,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew you more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly there may be in a ſoule a certain perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
though not a full perſwaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In all Faith there
is a perſwaſion, but in all Faith there is not a full
perſwaſion; the word in Scripture tranſlated full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 21. It is ſaid that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was fully perſwaded, it is put in oppoſition to
doubting of unbeliefe, being ſo, ſaith the text, <hi>hee
ſtaggered not through unbeliefe,</hi> and ſo <hi>Rom. 14. Let him
that eateth be fully perſwaded,</hi> that is, ſo perſwaded that
hee doth not eate with any ſcruple of mind or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſpirit; I may be perſwaded of a thing that
yet I am not fully perſwaded of, but have ſome doubts
of; yet when my reaſons for the affirmative are more
then for the negative, my mind begets a perſwaſion,
and enters a perſwaſion in my ſoule from the major
vote of reaſon; Now I cannot be ſaid to bee fully
perſwaded, unleſſe my ſoule runs without a rub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as it is
ordinary amongſt us, when wee are informed by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Witneſſes of ſuch a thing done, wee may bee
perſwaded it is true, and really beleeve the truth of it,
and yet will not ſweare it, and perhaps ſhall have ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and doubts, unleſſe we ſaw it our ſelves &amp;c. So
a Chriſtian may be perſwaded that Gods love is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, but till he feeles it as well as thinkes it, he
will hardly have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a full perſwaſion without
any manner of doubts or ſcruples concerning it.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>There is a great deale of difference betwixt a
perſwaſion for the preſent, and a perſwaſion for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
I am forced to put it in theſe Termes for want
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41393:121"/>
of other; I meane betwixt an aſſurance that my ſinnes
are actually pardoned, and a perſwaſion that they are
pardonable, and decretally and me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itoriouſly pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and I ſhall feel at laſt the ſeale of Gods love; I
muſt ſpeake here according to the manner of men: it
is true it may ſound harſhly, that a Chriſtian ſhould
beleeve only that God will pardon his ſins, and will
juſtify him, I know there be ſome learned and pretious
men that hold that the elected ſoule is pardoned, and
formally juſtifyed before he beleeves, and ſo would
make our juſtification, (as Maſter <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> ſaith wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily)
nothing <hi>but the fetching a Coppy out of the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll;</hi>
but I am of his mind in his late Treatiſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>p.</hi> 17. 8. where hee gives ſeverall Arguments
againſt this opinion, As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it bee ſo, then all the Elect were then made
bleſſed and happy, their ſins not being imputed, contrary
to Eph. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe this Doctrine would make juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
onely to bee declarative; when the Scriptures
tell us that our ſinnes are charged upon us till wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>becauſe Chriſt cannot as an head repreſent
thoſe that are not his members: now before actuall belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
we are no members of Chriſt;</hi> Indeed meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     </hi> 181.</note> and our ſoules are juſtified before we beleeve:
but I (with him) cannot ſee how we are formally and
actually juſtified before we beleeve: and to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
give me leave to add a fourth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Pardon of ſin and justification, it is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting
of the guilty ſoule before God for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of another; now how the ſoule ſhould be actually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41393:122"/>
before it be actually and formally guilty, I cannot
underſtand:</hi> And therefore I ſay, a ſoule may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that its ſins are pardonable, and ſhall be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and accordingly truly rely upon the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt for the pardon of them, which is true Faith,
though it cannot be fully perſwaded that its ſinns are
pardoned. And thus much may briefly ſerve to have
noted how far perſwaſion and aſſurance neceſſarily come
into the nature of true and ſaving Faith, and how not:
And concerning it I ſhall only nominate theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
to you, as containing the whole truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That a Chriſtian may have ſaving Faith, though
he cannot be fully perſwaded that God hath actually pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and blotted out his ſins, and formally justified him;</hi>
for a beleeving that my ſins are formally pardoned, is
to beleeve I am juſtified: and is the Faith of a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
perſon, not juſtifying Faith (properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That a Beleever may have true ſaving Faith,
though he could never yet at all be perſwaded that God had
actually and formally justified his ſoule by pardoning
his ſins.</hi> This is ſtill the application of the promiſe
to the ſoule, and a reflex act of Faith which condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
more to the ſoules comfort then its formall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That a Chriſtian may have true juſtifying
Faith, though he cannot at all times be fully and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
perſwaded that God will pardon his ſins;</hi> a rationall
man in a Feaver may have loſt his actings of reaſon,
though while he hath the being of a man, reaſon hath
a being in him; the tongue may belye the heart when
the actions cleer it; A Chriſtian may be at <hi>will God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41393:122"/>
pardon me</hi> with his tongue, when his heart really
thinks he will, and he manifeſtly ſhewes it by crying,
faſting, fearing to ſin, lying groveling at the doore of
free grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That a Chriſtian cannot have true ſaving ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
Faith, unleſſe he doth (I doe not ſay unleſſe hee
think he doth or unleſſe he ſayes hee doth, but unleſſe he
doth) beleeve, and is perſwaded that God will pardon his
ſins:</hi> it is eaſily perceived by its reſolving not to leave
crying, praying, walking holily and circumſpectly, that
it is perſwaded in this particular, that it is beſt both
ſimply and in compariſon to draw near to God, and
rely upon his grace,<note place="margin">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41393:123"/>
Writer of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our owne in ſeverall parts of his book
hath made out againſt them; Thou mayeſt have true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith, though for the preſent thou canſt not be fully
perſwaded that thy ſins are pardoned: yea though thou
mayeſt think that they are not pardonable (through
ſome accidentall temptation over-powring thee, or
ſome corruptions hindring the actings of Faith:) yet
thou mayeſt be perſwaded that they are pardonable,
and at that time it will appear to all the world that thou
art perſwaded they ſhall be pardoned to thy ſoule; by
thy fearing to offend God, and thy carefulneſſe to
pleaſe him by thy crying, faſting, weeping, lying at the
feet of divine grace, and reſolving if thou periſheſt, to
periſh at the gate of heaven, and meet with hell there
if thou meeteſt with it anywhere; Nay, be not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
this thy Faith is <hi rend="sup">1</hi> certaine, and <hi rend="sup">2</hi> ſtrong as well
as ſaving.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is ſaving,</hi> That I have already ſhewed you,
when I fully ſhewed you that the eſſence and pith of
juſtifying Faith was a fiduciall rolling our ſelves
and hanging upon the Lord Ieſus Chriſt for pardon.
Now as it is ſaving,</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>ſo it is strong;</hi> That Faith (ſaith a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Authour) is argued to be ſtrong that hath no light
of comfort, but walkes in darkeneſſe upon the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and borders of an hundred deaths. <hi>Davids</hi> Faith
was a ſtrong Faith, when though all Gods waves were
upon him, yet he <hi>called upon God daily. Pſa.</hi> 88. 7, 8, 9.
when the ſoule is ſo far from being perſwaded that it is
a lovely one in the Lords eyes, that it conceives it ſelf
a damned wretch in the Lords ſight, and onely ſees a
ſparkling light in at a crevis of the window, and by
a little pinhole, a beam of hope comes in, and it thinks,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41393:123"/>
well, my ſinnes are yet pardonable, yet I dare not ſay
there is no hope: yet I know not what to think, my
ſins are great Gaole-ſinns, I am perſwaded if my name
be in the Charter of grace, it is in the bottom, and it
is ſometimes ready to think that the little glimmering
of light it ſees, is rather the counterfeiting light of a
Glow-worm then the triumphing light of the Sun:
yet the ſoule is raviſhed with that particle of light,
and goes and kiſſeth the hole that gives it a paſſage,
and ſayes, well, here's all my comfort, my ſinnes are yet
pardonable, I ſee the ſhip of my ſoule is wrackt; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
this bit of board may ſave my life, I will on to it,
if I periſh I periſh; I will not loſe this pin-hole light,
I will cry, faſt, weep, and pray; Lord, ſay my ſinnes are
pardoned, I am perſwaded thou canſt pardon them,
and if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean; Lord!
here will I lie, filthy, bloody, full of ſores at the
Poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> I will not ſtirre a ſtep from the
Poole, I will lie in the way till thou haſt cured mee. I
ſay, this doth argue a ſtrong faith; the perſwaded aſſured
ſoule hath cables of comfort, who would fear the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them? God doth not rap his fingers ſo often
as this poor ſoule; This Believer hath but a twine thred
to hang upon; yet he catcheth hold, and ſayes, this
ſtraw ſhall bear my ſouls weight; yea, God raps off his
fingers often, his life is full of doubts and feares, yet
he holds and will not ſtirre a ſtep; doth it not argue a
great a reliance? The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> had no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Chriſts favour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 21. ſhe cryed, <hi>he
anſwered her not a word,</hi> v. 23. nay, when ſhe made friends
to him, he would neither heare her nor her friends me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
(though they were Chriſts own Diſciples) ſtill
ſhe comes and worſhippeth him, he chides her; (this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41393:124"/>
yet argued no aſſurance) ſhe replyes; he ſayes, <hi>Great is
thy Faith,</hi> v. 28. Mr <hi>Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that <hi>the fewer Externals that faith needeth, the ſtronger it
is within; little evidence, much adherence ſpeaketh a ſtrong
faith.</hi> Now though that perſwaſion be an inward work,
yet the grounds are externals; for the ſtrength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of perſwaſion is moved by the compaſſe of ſence;
the leſſer my grounds are, if my adherence be the ſame,
the ſtronger is my faith; if I will truſt my friends little
finger as much as his whole hand, doth it not the more
argue my confidence in his ſtrength, &amp; my reliance upon
him, that he will do what he can to hold me? Oh! it is a
ſweet thing to ſee a ſoul hang upon Chriſts little finger,
that only apprehendeth a generall promiſe, &amp; is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that its ſins are pardonable, &amp; ſometimes doubts of
this too; yet it cryes, and hangs, and weeps, and relies, &amp;
ſcorns to lay its little finger upon any thing elſe, any ſelf
ſufficiency, any creature-righteouſneſſe to bear it up; it
argues a ſtrong faith: O ſoul, be not deceived! Great
is thy faith; nay, and ſuch a <hi>faith may be certain too,</hi> thou
mayeſt live at uncertainties upon a certain faith: The
bruiſed reed is not broken, the ſmoaking flax is not

2 <hi>Thy faith is certain in reſpect of the Event:</hi> Even as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that hangeth upon a pin or a peg, is as ſure as
the pin or peg on which it hangeth: So that ſoule that
hangs upon the mercy and Free-grace of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt and the rocky promiſes of ſalvation, is as
ſure as the promiſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus I think I have ſufficiently cleared the firſt
thing, that a Chriſtian may have a true ſaving Faith;
yea and ſuch a one as ſhall be ſtrong and certain, both
in reſpect of the object and event, that yet hath not
this ſublime act of Faith, which is aſſurance. I haſten
to a ſecond concluſion, and all the reſt of my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
with reſpect to a full perſwaſion that our ſins
already are actually and formally pardoned.</p>
               <p>2. Concluſ. <hi>Thy Aſſurance and perſwaſion that thy
ſins are pardoned, may be a true perſwaſion and aſſurance,
though but weak; or to ſpeak more properly, you may have
this reflex act of faith, and be perſwaded that your ſins are
pardoned, and this perſwaſion may be a true reflex act of
faith, and yet not conſtant in degrees.</hi> Sometimes it
may be weaker, ſometimes ſtronger. I call the weakeſt
perſwaſion wrought in the ſoul, that its ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
a reflex act of faith; for I doe not think that it
is a piece of Faith neceſſary to the juſtification of
a ſoule, that it ſhould believe that its ſinnes are really
and actually pardoned, though it be a beame of grace
that the ſoule ſhould love, and look after more then
the world; and it is and ought to bee more pretious
to a believing ſoule, then all the rocks of gold, or
mountaines of ſilver or beds of ſpices, or ten thouſand
rivers of oyle; yet I ſay, I doe not take it to be an act
of juſtifying Faith, but of the juſtifyed ſoule. Now
this may be true in the ſoule, though it be ſometimes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41393:125"/>
weaker, and ſometimes ſtronger; That ſoule that all
times is perſwaded that its ſins are pardoned and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
remitted, is not alwayes a like perſwaded of it. It
is a beame of Gods manifeſtative love which admirs of
degrees. Now as upon the earth, in the day time there is
alwayes ſome light, though through ſome interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of clouds the light is not alwayes alike; ſo in
Chriſtians that the Lord hath brought to this degree
that they doe really believe that their ſinnes are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
though through the ſun-ſhines of Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtative
love upon their ſoules, they for the moſt part
think ſo, yet they are not alwayes alike perſwaded of
it. I doe verily believe that <hi>David</hi> generally was in this
temper; and who ſo peruſes his pretious book of
Pſalmes, will finde that he takes the pardon of ſinnes
for granted; yet who ſo againe peruſes the ſeverall
Pſalms, will eaſily perceive that <hi>Davids</hi> perſwaſion was
not alwayes alike, as any one may ſee by comparing,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. and <hi>Pſal. 41. verſ.</hi> 11. you ſhall finde him in
ſome Pſalmes altogether ſinging, and prayſing, and
triumphing, not a mention of a teare; but in others,
declaring perſwaſion, yet wants; expreſſing confidence,
yet teares; as in that ſixth Pſalme, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. Sometimes the heavens are ſo cleare
to gracious ſoules, that the ſhinings of grace dazzle
their ſoules ſo much, that nothing will ſatisfie them but
heaven; <hi>Now Lord let thy ſervant depart in peace;</hi> O that
now I might dye and be incorporated into glory! they
are ſo wrapt into the third heavens, that they cannot
ſpeak their joy; another while it is lower water with
their ſoules; the Moones influence is not as it was.
<hi>David,</hi> I am confident, would have beene glad of
an errand to have ſent him out of the world to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41393:125"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. But the good man again in the 39 Pſalm,
prayes as heartily for his life, as any poore wretch
could have done, that lay under an apprehenſion of a
paſt ſentence in hell againſt him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. we read of
a rejoycing, with which believers ſhould rejoyce, even
with <hi>joy unſpeakable,</hi> but there was not ſuch a conſtant
overflowing and full tide of joy alwayes ſure. It is a ſure
note, that manifeſtative love hath its degrees, and it is
from a ſtrong influence of Gods manifeſtative love
to the ſoule that the ſoule hath ſuch a perſwaſion;
now had I leaſure, I might at large here tell you, at
what times commonly the ſpring-tide of aſſurance
flowes higheſt, and on the contrary, what may make
the apprehenſion weaker, and at what times it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
moſt weak.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Commonly juſt upon Gods return after a long deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſad expectation, the ſouls aſſurance is very great,
and its perſwaſion very high:</hi> God turns mid-night into
mid-day: The ſoule then brings the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
into <hi>her mothers houſe, into the chambes of her that concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her:</hi> commonly when the husband comes home,
after a long abſence and long expectation, more then
ordinary tokens of love, and paſſages of love are diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
betwixt him and the wife of his boſome; Chriſt
comes in then to make amends for his frowns and
lowrings, with the ſweeteſt kiſſes and imbraces: Mid-winter
is turned into a Mid-ſommer, this you ſhall
finde conſtantly in <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes; and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
when the ſoule is under deſertions, if there bee
left yet a perſwaſion, that though God doth hide his
face, yet hee doth not hide his heart, yet it is but a
weak and juſt living perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>And commonly at greatest diſtreſſe, God comes in with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41393:126"/>
ſtrongeſt perſwaſions and fulleſt aſſurance,</hi> as when the
Chriſtian is cal'd to Martyrdom or cal'd to dye, or cal'd
to do any great ſervices, that it diſtruſts its own ſtrength,
and is ready to feare of faint, that nothing but the moſt
reviving quick and hot cordiall water can keep the
ſoule cleane, and able to undergoe that great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſervice that God cals for at his hands;
ordinarily now at ſuch times, the Lord is pleaſed to
come in with a fulneſſe into the ſoul. (It was but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
you heard by my Reverend Brother, that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God comes in with ſighes which are evidences to
ſence, when the ſoule is in greateſt ſtreights;) and we
ſhall finde that Gods promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was
often renewed to him and to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to <hi>Iacob;</hi> but
the diligent Reader ſhall obſerve, that God pickt out
that time, or thoſe times when he called his Saints to
ſome hard work in doing, of which their hearts might
ſink concerning the Lords promiſe. The originall
promiſe was in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 7. it was renewed to him, chap.
13. v. 15. when he was to goe out of the land, he ſcarce
knew whither, and leave it to others to poſſeſſe; and
to <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he went to <hi>Gerar, Gen.</hi> 26. 4. and to <hi>Iacob</hi>
going down to <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 46. 4. At ſuch times the
children of God are to doe double work, and had need
of double ſtrength, and ſo a double ſubſiſtence; when
<hi>Eliah</hi> was to go in the ſtrength of his meat forty dayes,
he had need eat a good meale; the Angel therefore
twice admoniſhed him, to <hi>ariſe and eat, 1 Kings,</hi> ch. 19.
6. 7. The journey was great which he had to go, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Stories of the Martyrs make this good; when
the Lord cald them to their great ſervice at the ſtake,
he prepared them for their double work with double
comforts, raviſhing their ſoules with glory, <hi>and ſo
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41393:126"/>
often, that God makes many of his deare Saints live upon
ſhort commons all their life time, when he brings them to
the hard work of dying, he gives them a glimpſe of glory;</hi>
This is a note of a pretious Divine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Tryal of faith.</note> who gives experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of it, and it is eſpecially when they die ſtrong tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
deaths; for alwayes it is not ſeen; it may be they
have had all comforts before, and may die in conflicts;
God will try how they can walk in the ſtrength of what
they have had, or if they have had no bread till then,
God will hardly call them to die without giving them
a cruſt; yet (as he ſweetly ſayeth) <hi>God walks in liberty
here, and will not have us to limit the breathings of the
holy Ghoſt to jump with the hour of our dying; for we may
make an idol of a begun heaven, as if it were more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
then Chriſt.</hi> By this you ſee (in ſtead of much
might bee ſaid) that aſſurances may bee weaker and
ſtronger, yet true; and this will be further made good
by my laſt Concluſion, which I will but touch, And
that is this:</p>
               <p>Concl. 3. <hi>Thou mayeſt have had, and againe have a true
aſſurance and full perſwaſion, and for the preſent have
none at all:</hi> I have ſpoken ſo much to this before, that
I ſhall need adde very little: It is neceſſary to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the true direct act of Faith, that it be a continued
act; and that ſoule never did truly rely at all, that ever
ſince it began to rely ceaſed to rely; but for a reflex act,
it may be wanting even in the ſoule that hath had it,
and may have it againe if God will pleaſe to turne
his face towards it; nay, I will queſtion whither ever
that Chriſtian had true aſſurance or no, that hath had
it, as he pretends, without any intermiſſion; for ſo long
as there remaines a Devill to tempt, or a fleſh to allure
to ſin, there will be ſometimes wants of full aſſurance;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41393:127"/>
yea, if there were none of them both, I would make it a
great queſtion, whither the wiſe God would ever keep
ſuch a deſpenſation of his love in a full Sun-ſhine to
any ſoule (though loved never ſo dearely;) I am afraid
though we have much talk of Faith of aſſurance now
adayes in the world, if the Lord ſhould come to ſift the
hearts of his poor creatures, he would ſcarce finde
the muſtard-ſeed Faith of adherence. 1. Overpowring
temptations. 2. Overgrowing corruptions. 3. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
diſtempers of Melancholy. 4. Divine deſertions
ſhall hinder aſſurance, and make the act to ceaſe; and
judge you then what ſoule it is probable ſhall have it
an inceſſant conſtant act. But I have done with this
laſt thing, and now I have ſhewed you what doubts
and weakneſſes may conſiſt with every act of Faith in
a truly gracious ſoule. Now I ſhould ſhew you from
what principle theſe doubts ariſe, and how they differ
from the doubts of unbelieving deſparing wretches.</p>

ſpeak ſomething to one ſcruple of
conſcience, which doth often perplex
many a good Chriſtian; and that is
want of feeling of Gods love &amp;c.
<hi>Ah!</hi> (ſaith many a poore ſoule) <hi>did I but indeed know

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41393:128"/>
thing.</hi> And this makes a Chriſtian think that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth nor may believe.</p>
               <p>Now there is a double feeling, for the want of which,
many good ſoules often complaine, and upon the
want of which they raiſe to themſelves concluſions
againſt believing. For want of a diſtinction I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
for once to coyne one, <hi>There is a feeling of peace,
and a feeling of ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The feeling of peace, is, <hi>when a poor Christian ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
God appeaſed to its ſoule, and feels him ſaying,
I am thy God, the God of thy ſalvation;</hi> this is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
which is that higheſt reflex act of Faith of
which I ſpake the laſt time, and ſhewed you what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and abatements it might meet with in a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:
Now this a true Chriſtian may want, though he
doth feel Gods ſpirit carrying him on to acts of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and vivification &amp;c. Of this I ſhall not
ſpeak, having ſpoken the laſt time, how farre it may be
wanted, weakened, or abated, or diſcontinued, even in
Gods true and dear children.</p>
               <p>2. But there is another feeling which for diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſake, I call <hi>a feeling of ſtrength;</hi> when a Chriſtian,
though he doth not feele Gods peace ſealed up and
aſſured unto his ſoule, yet he cannot deny but hee
feels his ſoul carryed out by God unto duties, to love
him, to deſire him, to delight in him &amp;c. Now this
latter feeling ought to ſatisfie the ſoul, when, though
God doth not pleaſe as yet to <hi>apply the promiſe to his
ſoule;</hi> yet he feels God enabling him <hi>to apply himſelfe
to the promiſe,</hi> when he feels God <hi>changing and renewing
his heart and affections</hi> &amp;c. But here is that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
poore Chriſtians want, and complaine for the want
of; they will confeſſe, that could they but feel God
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41393:128"/>
ſtrengthening them againſt their corruptions, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
out their hearts in acts of love, and deſire towards
him &amp;c they would quiet themſelves, and bee very
thankfull to him, if he would but give them ſo much of
the morſels of Free-grace as would keep ſpirituall life
in them, and keep their hearts from dying for want of
mouth-fuls, although God would not yet pleaſe to let
them ſit down at the banquetting table of aſſurance,
and eat of the ſweet meats of that peace which paſſeth
all underſtanding. If God would pleaſe to give them
but ſuch ſips of his flaggons as might ſtay them, though
they wanted ſuch diſhes of apples as to comfort them,
it would ſuffice; but alas! this they want, and how can
they believe? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now all that I ſhall ſpeak to a Chriſtian in this
perplexity I will reduce to theſe two heads.</p>

the interpoſition of the Moone doth hinder us in an

we ſee ordinarily will doe it; what ſhall we therefore
conclude that the Sun doth not ſhine? or that the
Sunne doth not caſt an influence upon the creatures?

had not the ſweet influences of Gods holy Spirit? if
ſo, we are confuted from the foregoing verſe, <hi>Cast me

By all which it may eaſily appeare that it is one thing
not to feel God ſtrengthening and quickning us, and
another thing for him not to doe it: The working of
Gods Spirit within us is very ſecret, according to the
nature of the Spirit; we doe not feele the ſtarres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon us, nor yet the actings of our ſoules with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us, and yet it is certaine, they have an influence
upon us: and that our ſoules do ſubtilly and ſecretly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41393:129"/>
act in all, in every part of our bodies: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſecondly,</p>
               <p>Conſid. 2. <hi>That the truth of Gods love to thee in his
acting in thee, is not ſo eaſily to bee diſcerned in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and working of God, as in the effect of ſuch acts and
operations;</hi> ſecret acts of ſpirituall ſubſtances are not
to be diſcerned and underſtood <hi>in agendo,</hi> but <hi>in affecto,</hi>
not in the doing but when they are done; we cannot
feel the ſoules conveying of its influence and power of
working through every part of the body, wee cannot
underſtand or ſee or feele the time when it doth it, nor
the manner how it doth it &amp;c. yet we know it is done,
and that is enough for us; thou canſt not ſee nor feel
the acting of the vegetative ſoule in the plant, thou
canſt not feel how it growes, or ſee when it growes or
underſtand the moment of its ſhooting out, yet thou
ſayeſt it doth act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the plant is grown, and the vegetative
ſoule in it hath queſtionleſſe been the internall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of its growth. You may poſſibly ſee a man in
ſome lethargick diſeaſe or in a trance, that you ſhall
not ſee or diſcern that his ſoule is yet in his body;
you ſhall not diſcerne his pulſe to beat, nor diſcern
him to breath, but all poſſibly in the room may judge
him dead: yet his body keepes ſtill warme, doth not
ſtiffen, or grow cold, his eyes are not ſet, nor his chap
fallen, and poſſibly by applying a glaſſe to his mouth
you may diſcern he yet breathes, and lives, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
you may gather the mans ſoule hath not yet
taken its leave of the body, for then you know hee
would grow ſtiff and cold: and ſo you conclude that
his pulſe doth ſtill beat, though ſo obſcurely that you
cannot feele or diſcerne it; ſo it may bee with
thy ſoule (Chriſtian); the inviſible worke of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41393:130"/>
God in acting his grace in thee, quickning, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thee, moving thee to ſpirituall duties, if thou
lookeſt to ſee it and feele it acting, as thou mayeſt
feel the beating of thy pulſe upon thy wriſt, thou mayſt
be deceived, it may beat darkly and ſecretly, it is a
ſecret work of a ſpirituall ſubſtance; and yet thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
be comforted in it, if thou wilt but look to the
effects; if thy ſoul and body do not grow ſtiffe and cold
&amp; ſtinking with old ſins and luſts and baſe corruptions:
there is ſome ſpirituall life that keeps thy ſoule warm;
though thou canſt not feele Gods ſecret and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
working in thy ſoule in the very act of warming and
quickning thee, and enabling thy ſoule to love him,
and deſire after him; yet ſpeake truth, does not thy
ſoule love him? doeſt thou not delight in him? doeſt
thou not deſire after him? come, let us put a glaſſe
to the mouth of thy ſoule; here's a baſe luſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which if thou acteſt, thou ſhalt bewray the
hatred of thy God to all the World; dareſt thou doe
it wilfully and knowingly? here is a prophane compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that would be glad of thy company; and at the
ſame time here's an Ordinance of God, at which if
thou wilt be, thou mayeſt poſſibly ſuck a great deale
of ſweetneſſe, and taſte much of thy God: where wilt
thou be? wilt thou baulk thy communion with God,
rather then with prophane and ungodly men? If thou
dareſt ſo, it is ſomething; but on the contrary, doth
no communion, no company pleaſe thee ſo as the
company of the Saints of God? and doth no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
like thee ſo as the communion thou haſt with
thy God in his Ordinances? If ſo, thou haſt ſome
ſpirituall life in thee; for the dead man hath no ſuch
judicious pallat; and if thou liveſt a ſpirituall life,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41393:130"/>
it is not thou <hi>that liveſt, but Chriſt that liveth in thee,</hi>
and thou liveſt <hi>by Faith in the Son of God;</hi> thus thou
mayeſt eaſily diſcern that in the effects, which thou
couldſt not in the working of the cauſe. But <hi>Alas!</hi>
(ſaith a poore Chriſtian) <hi>my willing and deſiring is
nothing; for though to will bee preſent with me, yet I
have no ſtrength to performe.</hi> And what <hi>will you make
a deſire to beleeve and pray Faith and Prayer?</hi> I anſwer,
<q>raw deſires and wiſhes are no more beleeving, then
<hi>Eſaus</hi> weeping for the bleſſing was the bleſſing, or
<hi>Balaams</hi> wiſh to dye the death of the righteous was
the happy end of ſuch as dye in the Lord. But the
ſincere deſires and good will of juſtified perſons are

concluſions grounded upon ſenſe are falſe and ſink

God to the beſt of his deareſt ſervants doth ſometimes
meaſure but an <hi>Ephah,</hi> and ſometimes but an <hi>Omer;</hi>
diſtinguiſh alwayes betwixt <hi>the truth of Gods love to
his deare children, and the actings, I meane the viſible
actings of his love;</hi> that of God which is not ſeene,
is alwayes full and certain to Chriſtians, I meane his
elective love, the yernings of his heart towards his
deare children; there is of God alſo that may be ſeen,
<hi>Pſal. 68. 24. They have ſeen thy goings O God, even
the goings of my God in the Sanctuary;</hi> Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in a poor ſoule are ſometimes very viſible to a
gracious ſoule, but ſometimes his goings are more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and inviſible, yet he is alwaies going in acts of love
and grace to his poore fervants, only his goings are
more myſterious and dark; God ſometimes goes a
meere foot pace, juſt ſets one foot before another in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41393:132"/>
them and towards them, ſometimes hee goes faſter
and more ſtrongly in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and apparently towards
them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods ſoft going in the ſoule may ſometimes bee
a cauſe</hi> why the ſoule cannot feel. <hi>Peter</hi> had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to feel the ſtrength of God alike, when he ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
denied his Maſter in the high Prieſts Hall, as
when hee durſt venture to walke on the Sea towards
him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God withdrawes ſome degrees</hi> of his ſtrength
ſometimes to try whether a Chriſtian can ſtand upon
the true legs of Faith, as well as upon the wooden legs
of ſenſe; the mother withdrawes her hand ſometimes
to ſee how the child can goe without truſting to the
feeling of her hand guiding and ſupporting it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another cauſe may be in the Chriſtian why
he cannot feele God carrying him out to acts of his
grace in his ſtrength alwayes alike; <hi>The ſoule may poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have lost its feeling;</hi> the benummed member doth
not feele; <hi>In ſickneſſes and deſeaſes of the body,
Nature may ſometimes bee ſo much infeebled, that ſometimes
the party affected falls into a dead ſwound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein he is dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prved
for a time, not only of the uſe of his underſtanding,
reaſon and memory, but alſo of his ſenſe, motion, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
functions.</hi> So it may be with a Chriſtian; ſin or
the violence of ſome temptations of Sathan may bee
ſuch, that the Chriſtian cannot feele any thing; the
ſoule caſt into a ſwound, and deprived of all the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
faculties of it, faith love, life &amp;c. no wonder
the ſoule for the preſent doth not feele: the leg of the
ſoule is aſleep, the whole ſoule is benummed, how
ſhould it feel? but let it alone a little: as ſuch body (if
not quite dead) will quickly returne to its ſenſe again
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41393:132"/>
and live, and feele, and move &amp;c. ſo likewiſe will the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſoule quickly come to recover its life, and ſenſe,
and motion againe; though the ſoule ſeemes (to the
judgement of ſenſe) to have no ſap or principle of life
in it; yet conſider it is winter-time with the ſoule,
ſtay but till the ſpring and ſummer, while the froſt
hath done nipping and diſcolouring, and the ſoule will
have its ſap viſible, and recover i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s beauty againe:
there is fire in the ſoule, though it be caked up in the
night; wait but till the morning that the aſhes be blown
away, you ſhall ſee the fire of Gods ſpirit is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
in the ſoule. I <hi>ſleepe,</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe)
<hi>but my heart waketh:</hi> there is a waking heart, though
there be no waking eye, the ſoule (as well as the body)
in ſleep is bereaved of ſenſe: wait but till the morning,
and the ſoule will confeſſe it ſeeth, and hath recovered
its ſenſes again. Thus for thy comfort know Chriſtian,
that thou couldſt not juſtly expect to feele alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
for firſt God doth not diſpenſe alwayes alike:
and ſecondly if he did diſpenſe alwayes alike, yet a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed,
aſhy, winter-ſleepy ſoule hath not that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or that ſenſe which a lively, healthy, well-tempered,
clear-ſpring-awakened ſoule hath.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, conſider <hi>That Gods ſtrength may be then ſeen
in thee, when it is not ſeen and felt by thee.</hi> The graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſoule is not alwayes, nay, is very ſeldome a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judge of it ſelf; the high Chriſtian may often
have a very low, yea, too low an opinion of himſelfe;
the Chriſtian is his own worſt conſtruing Book, and
eſpecially too at ſome times: if <hi>Paul</hi> may be judge
of himſelf, ſometimes he is <hi>the leaſt of Saints,</hi> and the
<hi>chiefeſt of ſinners,</hi> and <hi>unworthy to bee called an Apoſtle.</hi>
If <hi>David</hi> may be judge of himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22 v. 6. <hi>He
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41393:133"/>
is a worm and no man, yea, the very reproach of men.</hi> So if
many Chriſtians may be judges of themſelves: Alas!
<hi>they cannot pray, they cannot love God, they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
they feel nothing of the rength of God carrying them
out;</hi> when (if ſtanders by may be judges) there is a
great deale of the ſtrength of God manifeſted in their
hearts and carriages of their lives, and God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
diſcovered in carrying out their hearts ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and ſweetly, and firmely for him as he doth:
take a true Chriſtian, and this is a ſure rule, <hi>that God
and Gods people have far better opinions of him, then he
hath of himſelfe;</hi> now this may comfort thee, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better and more experienced Chriſtians (by thy
own confeſſion) then thy ſelf, can ſee more in thee,
then thou canſt feele; the body in a dead ſwound feels
no life in it ſelfe, but all its vitall motions and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are hindred: now therefore at ſuch a time, others
in the roome are Iudges of its life or death, they by
obſerving the warmth of the body, the motions of the
pulſe, or applying a glaſſe to the mouth of the ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
perſon, do perceive life in the man that to his
owne ſenſe, and perhaps to the ſenſe of ſome others is
a dead carkaſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, conſider <hi>that it is no Argument
to warrant thee not to beleeve, becauſe thou doest not feele
God carrying thee out by his armes of ſtrength in ſuch a
manner to ſpirituall duties, and the acts of ſpirituall and
ſaving graces as thou deſireſt, or perhaps expecteſt;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this is plain, <hi>becauſe it is my duty as well to beleeve
for ſtrength, as for any thing elſe;</hi> Sure I am, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are as much for ſtrength to act grace as for
any thing elſe: and the promiſes of God are the object
of my Faith; it is my duty to beleeve the promiſes,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41393:133"/>
                  <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee</hi> (ſaith God,) <hi>I will help thee and uphold
thee with the hand of my righteouſneſſe:</hi> thou ſayeſt this
cannot I believe. Why? <hi>becauſe God doth not ſtrengthen
me and help me carry out my heart in an act of Faith:</hi>
Thus thou beggeſt the queſtion; the queſtion is not
whither thou oughteſt to believe when thou feeleſt
God carrying thee on to believing &amp;c. But whither
thou oughteſt not to believe that God will ſtrengthen
thee, and carry thee out to acts of believing and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
&amp;c. But ſome may ſay, What doth this differ from
Free-will doctrine? Can I believe unleſſe God doth
ſtrengthen me to believe? Why, doe you call upon a
man to lay hold when he complaineth that he wants
hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or upon a man to walk, when he tells you he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find that he hath any legs? Miſtake not Chriſtian;
God hath ſaid, <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, I will help thee, and
uphold thee with the hand of my righteouſneſſe:</hi> Now I ſay
it is thy duty to believe this promiſe of ſtrength &amp; help,
and I confeſſe that it is not in thy power to believe
this promiſe, but God muſt ſtrengthen thee and help
thee before thou canſt believe this promiſe that he
will ſtrengthen thee and help thee; but yet I doe not
call upon one that hath no hands to lay hold, nor upon
one that hath no legs to walk, but upon one that ſaith
he doth not feele his legs, I call upon him to walk,
and I call upon one <hi>that doth not know and feele</hi> that hee
hath hands to lay hold &amp;c. And this is ſenſe, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Divinity; Faith is not ſenſible and viſible to
a Chriſtian in the habit, but only in the acts; I call to
thee to ſhew forth the habit of faith. Now it ſhall not
excuſe thee from this duty, that thou canſt not feele
thou haſt any habite of Faith; the habite of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
grace is inviſible. Thus have I given thee ſome
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41393:134"/>
conſiderations, which duly weighed and conſidered,
may comfort thy ſoule under this perplexity. I have
only one thing more to doe, and that is to ſpeak a
word or two of direction to ſuch ſoules to ſhew them
what to doe, that they may be comforted, in which I
will be briefe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then by way of direction, <hi>Finde out the cauſe
and remove it;</hi> the cauſes may bee various; I cannot
name them all; but the great and ordinary cauſes may
be, firſt Gods will; ſecondly, thy own temper.</p>
               <p>1. Gods will; he will not pleaſe perhaps to lead thee
with ſo ſtrong an arm at one time as at another; hee
will try how thou wilt live by faith; ſenſe is bread; he
will have thee not to <hi>live by bread only, but by every
word that commeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Now ſence
and feeling, that is bread; if this be the cauſe (as it was
in <hi>Peter)</hi> thou muſt not diſpute but ſubmit to it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The cauſe may be in thy ſelf;</hi> it may be thou art under
ſome violent temptations of Sathan, or under the
clouds and darkneſſes of ſome ſinnes or corruptions, or
thy expectation of feeling or ſenſe may be too high, or
thou mayeſt be wilfull, and not feel when thou mayeſt.
Theſe cauſes muſt bee removed by faith, repentance,
endeavour, obedience &amp;c. Hath ſin benummed thee?
be humbled for this ſinne, and thou ſhalt feele: Art
thou in deſertion? believe and hope, and thou ſhalt
feele again. It is a known maxime, <hi>Take away the
cauſe, and the effect will ceaſe.</hi> But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wait for feeling; <hi>this is is a part of thy
duty in relation to this want, eſpecially cauſed by Gods
will,</hi> Iſ. 40. 31. They that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew
their ſtrength like the Eagle. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 14. Wait on the Lord,
be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41393:134"/>
I ſay on the Lord: <hi>wait with faith and hope, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Learn to live upon Gods Word: Man ſhall not
live by bread only, but upon every Word that commeth out of
the mouth of God:</hi> We are not to live by faith upon the
incertainty of ſenſe: All that that ſpeakes is not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
but we have a more ſure and certain livelihood,
even the unchangeable goodneſſe, and infallible good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a God that cannot lie nor repent. Senſe is
deceiving, truth is infallible; doth ſenſe ſay God
doth not ſtrengthen me? and doth Gods word ſay,
theſe things I could not doe if God did not ſtrengthen
me? whither it be now better to believe God, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
ſenſe, judge thou.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Learn to acknowledged Gods little finger?</hi>
thou doeſt not finde God lending his whole hand, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not ſtrengthening thee in ſuch a meaſure to act
grace in ſuch a degree; but know the leaſt ſtirring of
the ſoul in a ſpirituall manner to a ſpirituall action is
from God; fleſh and blood could not doe it; find ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
out Gods little ſecret workings, look for theſe, thou
wilt finde ſome of them in thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>Act contrary to thy minde:</hi> we bid
the ſick man eat againſt his ſtomack; thou ſayeſt I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray, I cannot believe: why? I doe not find God
giving me an heart to it; doe it againſt thy minde; thou
ſhalt finde ſtrength to doe it, and <hi>comfort</hi> from doing
of it.</p>

4.</hi> 19. 20. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Abraham ſtaggered not at
the Promiſe of God through unbeliefe, but was ſtrong in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41393:136"/>
faith, giving glory to God.</hi> He doubted not through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
(ſaith Mr <hi>Ball)</hi> but he doubted of infirmity,
when he took <hi>Hagar</hi> to his bed, for the raiſing of him
a ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. v. 2. 3. and God <hi>(Gen. 15.</hi> v. 4.) had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
promiſed him an Heire; yea, ſo many children,
that the Starres of heaven ſhould be a leſſer number;
yea, did he not doubt <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 17. when the Lord had
promiſed him a ſonne? <hi>hee laughed and ſaid in his
heart, ſhall a child be born to him that is an hundred years
old? and ſhall</hi> Sarah <hi>that is ninty yeares old beare?</hi> I
know St <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>Abrahams</hi> laughing was <hi>riſus
exultantis, non deriſio diffidentis,</hi> the laughing of one
that rejoyced, and not the ſcorning of one that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted;
but (with all due reverence to that learned and
pious man) I doe not think that he hath fully ſolved
the knot. I doe not think it was a mocking of diſtruſt,
nor yet that it was a bare laughter of rejoycing. I
humbly conceive there was an exulting, but yet mixt
with a little doubting or diſputing; he rejoyced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the faithfulneſſe of the word, but yet his ſence
(through infirmity) quarrelled with his faith about it.
In the joy of his heart, he ſaid as <hi>Mary</hi> upon the like
tidings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. v, 38. <hi>Behold the ſervant of the Lord, let
it bee now unto me according to thy word;</hi> and yet through
infirmity, he ſaid, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> and therefore
in the very next words, v. 18. he ſayes unto God, <hi>O that
Iſhmael might live before thee:</hi> which words, as they
plainely expreſſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> good will, and wiſhing to
<hi>Iſhmael;</hi> yet (under correction to better judgements)
I conceive alſo from a comparing of the words before
and immediatly after, that they intimate a kinde of
doubting of Gods fulfilling his word: As if <hi>Abraham</hi>
ſhould have ſaid, Lord! I am overjoyed, and know not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41393:137"/>
how to believe this glorious word; I truſt God will
be as good as his word, but yet (to make ſure) <hi>Oh that</hi>
Iſhmael <hi>might live before thee!</hi> This (I conceive) wee
may ſee is intimated partly by comparing the words
with the former; God had juſt then promiſed him
a Sonne by <hi>Sarah,</hi> verſ. 16. and upon it he uttereth
this ſpeech; ſecondly, by comparing the words with
thoſe that immediatly follow, as Gods reply upon
that deſire of <hi>Abraham,</hi> v. 18. <hi>And God ſaid,</hi> Sarah <hi>thy
wife ſhall beare thee a ſonne indeed, and thou ſhalt call his
name</hi> Iſaac; As if God ſhould have ſaid, Art thou
diſputing <hi>Abraham? Indeed,</hi> my words ſhall come to
paſſe, I am not in jeſt with thee; nay more (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
thee) thou ſhalt call his name <hi>Iſaac.</hi> God addeth
two things in his reply to confirm <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.
1. The word <hi>indeed,</hi> 2. He particularizeth his Sonne by
name, which he ſhould have. So that it is plain he
doubted, yet (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he ſtaggered not through
unbeliefe:</hi> unbelief was not the predominant principle,
for he did believe it; but infirmity was the principle
from whence his doubting flowed. Let us a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the words of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.</note> and they will fully open
this particular, <hi>Rom. 4. 20. He ſtaggered not at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of God through unbeliefe, but was ſtrong in faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
glory to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe,</hi> did not quarrell at
the truth of Gods word, that he believed was true and
faithfull; his doubt was from himſelf; he was a hundred
years old, and his wife ninty; indeed, it is ſaid, v. 19.
<hi>That he did not conſider his own body now dead.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is to be underſtood <hi>in fine,</hi> he did not ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it as to let it conquer his faith in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbeliefe:</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:41393:137"/>
That was not the principle, a totall unbeliefe; it was
weakneſſe for the preſent, not unbeliefe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it was not ſuch a donbting, <hi>but hee gave
glory to God,</hi> in reſting upon his word as a true and
faithfull word, and waiting upon him for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.
Poſſibly there may be ſome thing in that
diſtinction which ſome of the Schoole-men make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>diſceptatio</hi> and <hi>dubitatio</hi> to our purpoſe; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did a little too much diſpute with his ſenſe upon
this, and ſaid to his fleſh a little too loud, <hi>How can
theſe things be?</hi> otherwiſe he would never have gone
in unto <hi>Hagar</hi> his maid: his ſenſe of weakeneſſe ſaid,
what ſhall I thinke? ſhall this come to paſſe? it is
out of the courſe of nature: but he did not doubt of
unbelief. I conceive doubting doth argue a more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledneſſe
of thought in the negative, then a meer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
doth; when a man is almoſt confident of a
thing, yet hath ſome ſcruples againſt it. I might
further add, that the word in the verſe tranſlated <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,</hi>
is by Criticks noted, to ſignifie rather a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and rebelling againſt, and falling away from
God, then a bare not believing of his promiſes fully
for the preſent; and therefore the Schole-men make
a great diſtinction betwixt incredulity and infidelity.
<hi>Abraham</hi> was for the preſent <hi>incredulus,</hi> but not <hi>infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi>
he did not doubt with ſuch a doubting as is the
doubting of an Infidell, that beleeved not the word of
God, but was for the preſent incredulous in reſpect of
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nfirmity; now on the contrary, the Reprobates
doubting proceedes meerely from a root of unbeliefe,
he beleeves not that the God that hath promiſed is
faithfull and juſt to performe, but ſecretly denieth
God in his heart, and doth not indeed ſo much <hi>diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:41393:138"/>
or <hi>dubitare,</hi> as <hi>apertè negare,</hi> not ſo much diſpute
or doubt, as openly and plainly deny Gods truth in his
word. Now examine thy doubtings by this marke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from whence are they? do they ariſe from unbeleef,
or from infirmity? as for example, ſuppoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden
and I will eaſe you;</hi> concerning this thou doubteſt now,
whether this promiſe belongs to thy ſoule, or may be
applied by thy particular ſoule yea or no, and thou
thinkeſt he that doubts this is damned. But peace
(Chriſtian;) whence ſprings this thinkeſt thou? The
promiſe is this in ſubſtance, <hi>that Christ will eaſe thoſe
weary and heavy-laden ſoules that come unto him;</hi> doeſt
thou not now beleeve this? yes; but thou doeſt not
beleeve the promiſe doth belong to thee: and why?
<hi>Oh! thou art not weary and heavy-laden:</hi> thou art not in
this [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] one that doubts
about the <hi>Promiſe of God,</hi> but one that diſputes his
owne baſeneſſe: and in regard of that doeſt not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeve. Thou wilt ſay, Ah! I know that that word
is a word of truth, whoſe matter is truth, and whoſe
Author is truth, but I doubt whether the truth of that
word doth belong to me: and this is the truth of thy
heart, which doth not doubt of the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to thoſe to whom it doth belong, but of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in it. I ſay this doubting may be in the deareſt
Saint of God; the unbeleever he doubts the truth of
the promiſe, he will not plainly ſay ſo with his mouth,
but in his heart he altogether denies God, and denies
his word. So that thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeſt here is a great difference
betwixt the one and the other, in reſpect of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
from which the doubtings of each ſpring.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a great difference betwixt their
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41393:138"/>
doubtings, <hi>in reſpect of the occaſion upon which they ſpring
in eithers ſoule.</hi> The occaſion in the Saints of God,
may be various.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Sathans temptations.</hi> Sathan is alwayes deſiring to
winnow us like wheate: if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e hath the fanning of us,
it is no wonder if our hearts be ſhaken with doubting;
hence often what the child of God hath firmely and
ſted faſtly believed a great while, al upon the ſuddain he
doubts: ſuch a ſudden doubting now contrary directly
to the former temper of our mind, is moſt like to be a
temptation of Sathan, when it is I ſay <hi>ſudden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to a firme Faith precedent and ſubſequent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>When thou doubtest only in reſpect of thy ſelfe,</hi> that
Sathan cannot prevaile with thee, ſo much as to have a
diſhonourable thought of God, or Ieſus Chriſt, or
the promiſes of the Goſpel. Sometimes the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy doubtings is <hi>thy preſent ſenſe of thy unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
either thou haſt been a great ſinner, or ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
thou haſt been a backſlider, or thou findeſt a
continued dulnes and deadneſſe and indiſpoſition of
ſpirit. Sometimes again the occaſion of thy doubting
may be <hi>a divine deſertion:</hi> God hath left thee in the
dark, and now thou crieſt where is my God become?
ſometimes the occaſion again of thy doubting may
<hi>bee a totall abſence of ſence, when God takes away ſenſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
and oppreſſeth thee with a preſent danger.</hi> This
was <hi>Peters</hi> caſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 28. he was ſinking, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with a preſent danger. Theſe are now the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
with many more ſuch like, which make the
child of God doubt; and take him at another time,
when Sathan doth not batter him, when the ſenſe of
his unworthyneſſe doth not terrifie him, when God
hath not withdrawn himſelfe from his ſoule, when hee
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41393:139"/>
is not oppreſt with a floud of danger ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
him, the man doubteth not at all. But
now the reprobates doubts are occaſioned by deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts; God ſayes to him as <hi>Ier. 2. 25. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thy foot from being unſhod, and thy threat from thirſt;</hi>
but thou ſaidſt <hi>there is no hope;</hi> the caſe is deſperate
with me; and there is good reaſon for his deſpairing:
for at that ſame time that he ſayes <hi>There is no hope,</hi> he
alſo ſayes, no: <hi>For I have loved strangers, and after
them will I go;</hi> I have loved my ſinnes, and lived in
them, yea, and I will love and live in them; and for ſuch
wretches they truly ſay <hi>There is no hope.</hi> Here's a great
difference betwixt the Beleever and the Reprobate in
doubting; the Reprobates <hi>hope is cut off from before the
Lord,</hi> their hope is <hi>as the giving up of the ghoſt,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi>
ſpeakes <hi>Iob</hi> 11. v. 20. Now the Saint of God though
hee doubts, yet hee doubts not without abundance of
hope: hee hath a ſtrong and lively hope for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he doubteth. The Lord ſayes to the
wicked, <hi>Returne you now every one from his evill way and
make your wayes and your doings good</hi> (the bleſſing upon
it is not expreſt:) And they, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> and what
then? <hi>Wee will walke after our owne devices, and we will
every one do after the imagination of his evill heart.</hi> Now
the Beleever although he be ready to dye with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet he hopes <hi>Pro. 14. 32. The righteous hath hope
in his death;</hi> So that the occaſion of the wicked
wretches doubting, is either an atheiſticall ignorance,
or a plain deſpair of mercy. They ſay <hi>there is no hope;</hi>
and hence it is that terrors make the wretches afraid;
and this is eaſily ſeen: for if deſpaire be their principle
or occaſion, they will reſolve to damne themſelves to
purpoſe, and ſay with the Iewes <hi>Wee will walk after our
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41393:139"/>
own wayes &amp;c.</hi> ſeeing there is no hope as we conceive
that God will doe us good, we will reſolve to do him
as much miſchiefe as we can; this is the ſecond note.
Now Chriſtian examine thy doubtings by it: doeſt
thou think there is no hope, and therefore doubteſt
whether the promiſe belongs to thee or no? or hath
Sathan been buſie with thy ſoule by his temptations?
or hath God withdrawn his comfortable preſence a
little? or art thou under the ſenſe of a preſent ſad
danger? and have theſe occaſioned thy preſent doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Thus the beſt Saints of God may doubt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thou mayeſt diſtinguiſh thy doubting <hi>by
the object about which thou doubtest;</hi> examine the object
of thy doubting.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Something in God is ordinarily the object of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eds
doubt, but the object of the Beleevers doubting is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
ſomething in himſelfe, ſomething below the Creator.</hi>
The Beleever hath ordinarily high thoughts of God
and Jeſus Chriſt: his low baſe thoughts are of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he lookes upon God as a God mighty in his power of
mercy, free of his loving heart to poor creatures: but
he ſayes, <hi>Lord I am unworthy that thou ſhouldſt come under
my roofe,</hi> therefore I doubt whether thou wilt or no;
will the Lord, pardon one that hath refuſed pardon,
denyed him, ſlidden back from him? the Beleever
ſayes not, God cannot ſave me, nor yet God will not
ſave me, but <hi>I will not bee ſaved. Ah! Sir, it is my baſe
heart is my damnation, I cannot goe to Ieſus Christ.</hi> Ah!
I cannot beleeve, therefore I am full of doubts: hee
doubts of his own goodneſſe, not of Gods, he hath all
this while high admiring thoughts of the free grace of a
ſinne-pardoning Saviour. Now the wicked wretch he
ſayes God is not mercifull enough; God doth but jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41393:140"/>
with ſinners, his Goſpell cals all ſinners, his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
book ſayes he will call but ſome: I doubt whether
I be one of thoſe that am called but not choſen; thus
the wretch layes all the fault upon God, Chriſt never
dyed for me &amp;c. God will never ſave me &amp;c. ſtill the
the wretch makes the mole in Gods eye, and forgets
the beame which is in his owne eye; the power of
God, the free will and grace of God, upon theſe is all
the blame laid, and concerning theſe he doubts. The
reaſon of this difference is very plaine.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe it is naturall to every carnall wretch to
exalt himſelfe,</hi> no fault muſt be in themſelves: no, they
pray, they faſt, they are good Churchmen, they read, &amp;c.
they beleeve as well as any in the Country where they
live, they tythe mint and anniſe; now therefore if God
will not ſave them, it is not becauſe of their blindneſſe
and ſin, for <hi>are they blinde?</hi> like the Papiſt, if he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
Heaven, it ſhall not be becauſe he doth not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it, but meerely becauſe God will not giue it him;
like thoſe <hi>Matth. 7. 24. Lord, wee have prayed in thy

we have caſt out Devills,</hi> therefore <hi>open to us.</hi> Naturall

                  <hi>Lord, who am I</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lord, I
am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roofe;</hi> but
it is a doubting of Gods willingneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is not a doubting of Gods willingneſſe,
bottomed upon a deep and horrid ſenſe of their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
but a doubt of Gods willingneſſe, yet ſuppoſing their
owne worthineſſe.</hi> The beſt child of God may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have ſo low apprehenſions of himſelfe, and his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41393:140"/>
own vileneſſe and unworthineſſe, that he may ſeeme a
little to doubt of Gods willingneſſe, or at leaſt diſpute:
he may <hi>(diſceptare,</hi> if not <hi>dubitare)</hi> ſay, will God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to ſuch a wretch as I am? though hee hath a
good meaſure of confidence and perſwaſion in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim</hi>
that he will, not underſtanding that even in this
there is a ſecret diſhonouring of God, and ſlandering
of the Charter of free grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, now on the contrary, the childe of God
<hi>makes ſomething in himſelfe the object of his doubting, in
regard of the exceeding low thoughts of himſelfe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

of ſo unclean an heart, that hath not ſo baſe an heart as
I have; though yet I ſay here is a miſunderſtanding of
infinite love: for Chriſt came not <hi>to call the Righteous,
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

free grace, muſt carry his money where it is to be ſold;
here it is to be had, but not to be ſold: Chriſt hath a
Granary of free grace, but all money ſhall be returned
againe in the ſacks mouth: it ſhall never be ſaid that
the deſerts of a creature made the King of free grace
rich. Thus thou mayeſt by a third marke, difference
the doubts of thy beleeving ſoule from the doubts of
carnall unbeleeving wretches.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thou mayeſt difference them in their duration
and continuance.</hi> It is truth, the beſt Saints of God
ſometimes doubt, but they do not alwayes doubt: they
have theiitwilights, but they have their noondayes too.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41393:141"/>
Hence you ſhall often heare the children of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the inconſtancy of their ſpirits; at ſometimes
their ſpirits are as cleare as fountaine-water, not ſoiled
with the leaſt mud of doubting: ſometimes again there
is nothing of clearneſſe ſcarce in them: ſometimes not
a cloud in their ſoules: ſometimes they are full of
clouds; and as it is ordinarily with the clouds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
one paſſeth and another commeth, none returneth,
but paſſeth and vaniſheth; ſo it is ordinarily with the
poor ſoule that with its true Faith hath a mixture of
doubting. Give me leave to commend unto you
four or five Notes, which in my little experience I
have obſerved concerning the doubts of beleeving
ſoules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>ordinarily, they are moſt in the morning,</hi> In the
beginning of their converſion; it is a country obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the greateſt darkeneſſe is juſt about break of
the day; the greateſt doubt of a Chriſtian is juſt about
the breaking out of the day of grace in their hearts,
when the Son of righteouſneſſe is comming forth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
darkneſſe is his uſher; it is an ordinary note.
It is <hi>Gregories</hi> note in his comment on the 33. <hi>chap.</hi>
of <hi>Iob, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> quidem quiſque &amp;c.</hi> every Chriſtian (ſaith
he) in the beginning of his converſion hath abundance
of ſweet conſolation, but preſently ſuffers hard labour
&amp;c. It is then the Devill one while perſwades his ſins
are not ſo great to need ſo much repentance, and by
and by againe that they are too great to be pardoned;
one while he would oile them up to preſume, another
while hurle them downe to deſpaire; one while they
doubt whether they bee elected or no, another while
whether they bee ſufficiently humbled or no: then
they feare their ſinnes are too great to bee pardoned:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41393:141"/>
anon they think they have ſinned the ſinne againſt the
holy Ghoſt &amp;c. experience makes this good; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Devill knowes that yet a little while and they
will be too ſtrong for him &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is poſsible that when their day is come they
may have ſome clouds too:</hi> You know that the faireſt day
may have a cloud, and an Ecclipſe may cauſe a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
at brighteſt noone. So the children of God after
they have got beyond their rugged way, and be paſt the
threſhold, may be thickned through the remaining va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of corruption in the heart of the Chriſtian; it
may bee ecclipſed, through the withdrawing of the
favour of God from it, by the interpoſition of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
this is poſſible. The experience of <hi>David,</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> and all the Saints of God in this life proves it;
who lives the life of grace and doubts not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thirdly,</hi> Thoſe in the Chriſtians day, are weaker
and fewer then thoſe of his morning, ordinarily.</p>
               <p>1. The darkneſſe occaſioned by a tranſient cloud,
or by an ecclipſe, is ſeldome ſo much as that which is
at the day-breaking; when the Chriſtian hath got
over his firſt feares and ſorrowes. I dare not acquit
him for ever. No, no, the dayes will not come (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eternity be our portion) when all teares ſhall bee
wiped from the Saints eyes, and they ſhall not hunger
nor thirſt any more. But this I dare ſay, they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meet with ſo many clouds interrupting their light
againe; their worſt and hardeſt work is over, although
all their work bee not over; they ſhall never have ſo
many thornes in their fleſh, though they may have a
pricking of thornes afterward.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>No nor ſhall they be ſo ſtrong:</hi> The reaſon of this is
plaine, The weakneſſe of grace is the ſtrength of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41393:142"/>
and the ſtrength of corruption is the ſinewes of
doubting; now the Chriſtian hath got more ſtrength of
grace, and corruption hath been overcome in many a
battell, and though the child of God hath not cleane
rooted it out, yet hee hath routed it in many a ſet
battell, weakned the ſtrength of it; therefore it is, that
though the Saint meets with feares and doubts, and
they thruſt out their ſtrength againſt him, yet he hath
not ſo hard work. For</p>
               <p>1. <hi>He is grown in knowledge:</hi> Ignorance was a great
cauſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>He is grown in grace:</hi> Want of faith was a great
cauſe.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>He is grown in experience:</hi> He begins to know
the wiles and ſtratagems of the Devill now; thence it
is that thou ſhall ſeldome ſee a Chriſtian ſo long
tugging under a doubt or temptation, when once his
firſt hard work is over, as he was with ſome of his firſt
doubts.</p>
               <p>A fourth note that I have obſerved concerning
believers doubts, is this, <hi>Thoſe that once paſſe, ſeldome
returne.</hi> If a Chriſtian hath once doubted his faith
upon a conceit <hi>he is not enough humbled,</hi> or that <hi>he is
not elected,</hi> or <hi>that he hath ſinned the ſin againſt the holy
Ghoſt</hi> &amp;c. Let him (I ſay) but once have got over, and
you ſhall ſeldome ſee him ſtumble upon the ſame ſtone;
poſſibly, till the wound be fully cured, there may bee
breakings out againe. It may be afterwards he may
doubt his condition; but if he doth, it ſhall be upon
another ſcore, ſomething elſe that he hath found out
to quarrell with his own ſoule upon: His enemies are
like the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> thoſe doubts his enemies, <hi>which he
ſees this day, hee ſhall ſee no more from hence forth even
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41393:142"/>
for ever:</hi> or if they ſee them afarre off, they ſhall flee
at firſt ſight, they ſhall ſee them as conquered captives,
that their ſight is but as a Generals over-looking the
field, when he hath ſlaine the Enemy; he will tell you
Sathans objections, but he will ſhew you the bullet that
kild him; hee cryes out, O doubts where are your
ſtings? <hi>O hell! where is your Victory?</hi> Thus they are
like the clouds of the heaven, which paſſe and vaniſh
and return not again, but like priſoners in fetters to
doe homage to their Conquerour.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This I have obſerved, <hi>That believers have no
doubts but they conquer at laſt:</hi> Doubts are but pieces of
corruption guilded a little; the doubt is chaffie, though
it be ten to one but there is a kernell of wheat in the
eare darkned from our eye by the intervening of the
chaffe. Now God never conquered a Saints heart, to
let any fierce corruption (though the moſt fair-lookt
limb of hell) rule over it. God gives doubts leave
to try their skill, but upon this condition, that they
ſhall be content to be trodden under foot: God hath
ſaid to Sathan after much intreaty, <hi>Behold, all his comfort
and peace and quiet,</hi> (and yet that but for a moment, a
little moment neither) <hi>is in thy power; only upon himſelf</hi>
[his life and being] <hi>thou ſhalt not put forth thy hand.</hi>
Thou ſhalt (ſaith God) if thou wilt, be a combatant,
but he ſhall be the conquerour. There is ſcarce a child
of God but hath his heart full of enſigns, conquered
colours of his enemy hanging up there. Now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
by this you ſhall know whither your doubts bee
ſuch as are conſiſtent with ſaving faith in your ſoules:
have not you gotten the day over ſome of your doubts,
concerning which you can ſay, The God of peace hath
already trodden Sathan under your feet? and doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41393:143"/>
you fight againſt your preſent doubts, with great hopes
that ſhortly you ſhall tread upon the necks of theſe
too? have you not found that Sathan hath put his
ſtrongeſt cavalry in the front, and moſt aſſaulted you
in the morning of your converſion unto God? have
not you found that thoſe doubts which you have ſince
met with are fewer and weaker then thoſe of the firſt
ſort? doth not Sathan begin to draw his bow as if hee
wanted ſtrength, and his arm were now grown feeble,
and he began to quit the field? hath he not done his
worſt think you? have not you found that the clouds
that have paſt are vaniſhed? doe you finde your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
enemies revive? or are they not rather ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you? their not returning as it proceeds from
Sathans policy, that will not rally his beaten forces
againe for feare of a ſecond rout, ſo it alſo proceeds
from the encreaſe of knowledge and grace in your
ſoules. Theſe are notes that may aſſure you your
doubtings are not the doubtings of carnall deſpairing
wretches; their doubts return ſtill, they are at the
ſame ſtumble, <hi>God will not ſave us, he cannot ſave us.</hi>
Let us doe what we will, yet ſay they, <hi>there is no hope.</hi>
But I haſten to a concluſion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, therefore, you may difference your
doubtings from the doubtings of unbelieving wretches
<hi>by the effects:</hi> Let us ſee a little what the effects of
doubtings are, both in unbelieving wretches, and alſo
in the ſervants of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are the Effects of thoſe doubtings
which are in unbelieving wretches?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A going away from God; they ſay, <hi>It is in vain
to ſerve Lord,</hi> in vaine to pray more or heare more, in
vaine to wait upon God. <hi>This evill is of the Lord</hi> (ſaid
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41393:143"/>
that wretch,) <hi>Why ſhould I wait for him any longer?</hi> So
theſe ſay, our damnation is of the Lord, why ſhould we
pray to him any longer? Why ſhould we mourn any
more? <hi>There is no hope:</hi> No, <hi>Come! let us eat and drink,
for to morrow we ſhall dye.</hi> Mark this, in that 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>Ier. 11. 12. And they ſaid there is no hope:</hi> What then?
<hi>Wee will walk after our own deviſes, and we will every one
doe the imagination of his own heart:</hi> Here's the effect,
that the doubting of unbelievers works in their
hearts; a wilfull, deſperate departing from God, and
reſolving to walk contrary unto him. But now, on
the other ſide:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What Effects doth doubting, work in the
the hearts of believers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I conceive that the doubtings of the Saints of
God produce theſe foure or five contrary Effects in
the hearts of them that feare God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A complaining unto God:</hi> The believer runs to
God and ſayes, Ah Lord! I know not what to do? but
my eyes are towards thee: Ah Lord! I know not what
to anſwer: Lord! doe thou anſwer for me: I have a
baſe heart, cloudy; Lord cleare it! yea, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
of himſelfe, he ſayes with <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 10. v. 1. <hi>I
will leave my complaint upon my ſelfe.</hi> The unbelieving
wretch, he complaines indeed, but he leaves his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
upon God.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Effect that the believers doubts work in
his heart, is, <hi>a begging mercy of God:</hi> Lord help (ſaith
he) my eyes are to thee: Lord, ſatisfie my poore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoule; Thus did <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> conſtantly. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
never carries the burthen of his ſpirit to Jeſus
Chriſt that he might have eaſe: The believer never
keeps his burthen upon his own ſhoulders till it break
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41393:144"/>
his back: The unbeliever ſayes, <hi>there is no hope;</hi> his dead
heart hath no principle of life in it in the world to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it out to God, but <hi>he ſincks like lead in the mighty
waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third Effect that the believers doubts work in
his heart, is, <hi>a ſtriving and ſtruggling againſt them:</hi> He
ſtrives thus to make his calling and election ſure, he
looks out for ſtrength, ſearches the Word of God to
ſatisfie him in his ſcruples, enform him in his miſtakes,
to deliver him from his feares, and comfort him in his
ſadneſſes and dejections of ſpirit, he enquires at the
mouth of Gods Miniſters, he <hi>goes about the City and
ſtreets and broad places, enquiring, ſaw yee him whom my
ſoule loveth? If hee meeteth with the watch-men, hee
enquires of them, Cant.</hi> 3. 4. He doth not look upon it
as his duty to ſit ſtill as dead. On the contrary, the other
ſtrives not; he ſayes, <hi>There is no help:</hi> To what purpoſe
is ſtriving then?</p>
               <p>A fourth Effect that the doubts of the believer
produce, is, <hi>a waiting for God;</hi> his ſight is cloudy, yet
hee waits; I will ſtay ſaith he, and ſee if God will not
ſatisfie my ſoule in this difficulty: The other ſayes, as
he, 2 <hi>King. 6. 33. This evill is of the Lord, why ſhould I
wait for him any longer?</hi> The Saint ſayes: Yes, <hi>Iſ. 8. 17.
I will wait upon him that hides his face from the houſe of
Iacob.</hi> I will wait upon him that yet covereth me with
a cloud, and makes darkneſſe to be round about me; hee
ſtands at Gods doore yet, crying, craving, waiting, till
the Lord comes into his ſoule.</p>
               <p>A fifth Effect (which ſhall be the laſt I will name)
which doubting produceth in the believing ſoule, is,
<hi>a walking with God:</hi> What ſayes the doubting believer,
Well, though I doe not know whither I am enough
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41393:144"/>
humbled, yet I am weary, I will goe to Chriſt for eaſe;
though I doe not know whither I be choſen of God or
no, yet I will chuſe God to be my God. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from him though he kills me, I will walk as neare
as I can, according to the rule of his word; though I
be full of feares, I will not ſtart from his precepts;
though thou killeſt me, yet I will truſt in thee. The
wicked doth contrary, as you heard before, from <hi>Ier.
18.</hi> 11, 18.</p>
               <p>And now Chriſtians, try your ſelves by this note;
what effects doe your doubtings work in your hearts?
You doubt ſometimes (poſſibly) whither you belong
to God or no; doe you then reſolve to make ſure of it
by a wilfull departure from God, and a rebellion againſt
God? or doe you at this time complaine to God,
cry unto him, to lift up the light of his countenance
upon you, ſtrive againſt your doubts, wait for Gods
Revelations of his love? and at this inſtant in the
midſt of all your ſad doubts, walk cloſely with God
according to the rule of his word? Canſt thou ſay,
Though I have been afflicted very much, yet <hi>have I
not departed from thy judgments:</hi> Bee of good comfort
(Chriſtian) God ſhall wipe theſe teares from thy eyes.
<hi>And the God of Peace ſhall bruiſe Sathan under your feet
ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16. 20.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with ſuch doubts and ſcruples
as may ariſe in gracious ſoules, concerning the nature
and acts and degrees of Juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p>To God only wiſe be glory through Ieſus Chriſt for ever,
<hi>Amen,</hi> Rom. 16. 27.</p>
